Revision 1.3  2001/09/30 00:51:10  terrible
Debian packaging updated to 0.4.47-1.

Revision 1.2  2001/09/29 14:58:35  terrible
Updated Debian files version to 0.4.45-1.

Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/09/11 13:58:18  set
Imported sources.

Revision 1.386  2001/09/09 22:16:36  set
* Fixed: [BC++/Win32] Some unused parameter warnings.
* Fixed: [DOS] Missing header in stackdbg.c (code I blindly wrote on Linux)
* Fixed: Unreachable break detected by BC++.
* Fixed: BC++ doesn't like default argument values in the function itself.
* Fixed: Missing string.h in pperl.cc (gcc 2.95.2 doesn't report it for
internal functions).

Revision 1.385  2001/09/09 20:31:58  set
* Added: A tool to find the empty and fuzzy entries in a .po file. Is
called emptymsg. If you call it passing the names of the .po files to it
from the editor you'll get a list of missing/fuzzy entries that you can
browse using Alt+F7/F8. It combined with the special lines (it moves line
hits as text is added/deleted) and the .po SHL makes much more easy to
complete .po files.

Revision 1.384  2001/09/09 20:24:11  set
* Added: A new option to avoid making backups for some particular files.
The setting is just a list of regex (Perl style) stored in a text file. If
a file name matches any of the regex the editor doesn't create a backup.
This option is only available in the standalone editor but is relative
easy to hook the needed stuff to the class (for RHIDE).
* Added: The above mentioned option to the documentation. Also updated the
File Open options and mentioned the Options button. Documented the new
block case functions. Updated the list of SHLs supported.
* Added: A new macro to the docs called @p{} to replace @paragraph{}, it
is much more convenient.
* Added: A separated header file for loadshl.cc.
* Updated: The spanish translation. Also generated the german file so any
user could complete it. I think 148 translations are missing or incorrect
(fuzzy filled) in the german file.
* Modified: [UNIX] Now the editor loads ~/.file first that ~/file for any
configuration file. I did it because when saving the editor choose ~/.file
first.

Revision 1.383  2001/09/09 00:26:11  set
* Fixed: When I changed from absolute to relative projects the memory of
settings for project items got broken. It was long time ago but I didn't
realize it because it worked for projects where all files are in the same
directory and the closed windows also have memory. Now is fixed.

Revision 1.382  2001/09/08 23:29:25  set
* Added: Block invert case and alternate case. I reused the code of block
toupper/lower and created those new funny functions.
* Fixed: [UNIX] One of the new messages printed at exit didn't check if we
effectively redirected stderr trying to print a null pointer.
* Modified: Now File Open dialogs not only remmembers paths+masks but also
file names (full qualified).
* Fixed: When adding items to a project the only way to exit is by pressing
ESC, but then the editor didn't remmember the path we used and when
inserting again we must get it from the history. Now remmembers it.
* Added: The number of lines of the saved text (not only size).

Revision 1.381  2001/09/08 21:40:39  set
* Added: Code page remap for a block of text (no the whole file). It have
undo and I reused code from toupper/lower block.

Revision 1.380  2001/09/08 17:56:38  set
* Fixed: The "backspace unindents" could get confused with lines containing
only spaces.
* Fixed: The my_popen code used in stackdbg.c and the derivated used in
symify to close the right file handle and in the right order in the child
process. I noticed it looking how libc's popen is implemented.
* Fixed: I completly rewrote the my_pclose function used in the above
mentioned sources because it created zombie process. I also made it more
robust. I must do some adjusts yet, but now works OK (is just slow).
* Fixed: If argv[0] was just a file name (no relative path and no absolute
path) the code failed to detect if it had debug symbols.
* Added: Credits to Bjorn and Grzegorz in the about dialog.
* Added: A note about djgpp's implementation of putenv.
* Fixed: Now child processes created by run a program are put in a
separated session and I kill the group. It is more effective when the child
creates other processes and one of them hangs. Killing the first child is
not enough, so now I kill the group. Note: it have an interesting side
effect that will introduce some changes soon, but is better.

Revision 1.379  2001/09/08 00:16:36  set
* Modified: [UNIX] Now when expanding compressed info files the temporal
file is removed just after opening it. Making it we don't let those
temporals when the editor crashes or we debug it. Is only enabled for UNIX.

Revision 1.378  2001/09/07 23:48:53  set
* Added: [Linux] Now the editor also dumps a stack trace when crashes. I
also added a message informing the user where the unsaved buffers and crash
information can be found.
* Added: [Linux] Two new behaviors in case of a crash. One calls gdb to
get a detailed stack trace and information about local variables the other
not only does it but also gives the control to gdb so we can get more
information. If we are in a X a separated xterm is created for gdb, that's
really cool! I based it in code by Bjorn Reese <breese@mail1.stofanet.dk>
that Grzegorz sent me.
* Added: A command line switch to select the behavior of the editor in case
of a crash. It supersedes the --no-signal option. Also sorted the command
line options. The name is --stack-dbg (d).
* Added: An environment variable to set the default behavior of -d option.
* Updated: man page to reflect the new command line. Also added two
environment variables (the new one and other) and sorted the options
alphabetically.
* Added: [Linux] A tool equivalent to djgpp's symify to process stack
traces. (tools/symify.cc).
* Fixed: After adding some routines to edspecs.cc InfView gave undefined
references, so I added a dummy to avoid it.
* Updated: Spanish messages.
* Fixed: I was damaging argv[0]. It was easy to see when running ps, the
editor name had a space after the last slash.
* Added: A small script to install the editor without stripping debug
information. It will allow me to start gdb each time the editor crashes on
my system. I also added the needed code to the makefile and installation
scripts.
* Modified: Now I call TEventQueue::suspend() from the signal handler
instead of suspend_keyboard(). I know that's more dangerous but uses a
standard mechanism.
* Added: Now the editor also prints the signal number in the error file.

Revision 1.377  2001/09/05 19:19:08  set
* Modified: More details in the routines that closes undesired editors.
Damn is really tricky.

Revision 1.376  2001/09/05 17:45:27  set
* Added: A new option to the Run program options dialog. When enabled and
we get errors from the child process the editor jumps to the first line
with errors (like in RHIDE).

Revision 1.375  2001/09/05 17:19:43  set
* Fixed: When enabling the column cursor in a window that wasn't restored
from disk it sometimes was shorter than what we expect. It was due to a
wrong initialization of CrossCursorCol member, the same could happend with
the row cursor.

Revision 1.374  2001/09/05 16:55:48  set
* Modified: Now I extended the option to forget the cursor position to also
forget about other settings remmembered for closed and project files.

Revision 1.373  2001/09/05 16:45:59  set
* Added: Now the "Open only specified files" option is divided in various
options to give more control about what is stored in the desktop file. Now
the windows are divided in three types: Editor, Non editors and Closed
Editors. For each group is possible to set if we want to: remmember it,
remmember it but if the command line contains file names forget or just
don't remmember. These nine options replaces the old one. I added it
because some users didn't like the current behavior and wanted a
differerent behavior to the one that Ivan sugested when I added it. In
particular Tatu || Vantte Kilappa <elfire@kymp.net> wanted a middle ground
behavior.
* Modified: Version to 0.4.47. So we can adapt the old setting and select
three of the new ones that are equivalent.
* Added: An option to not remmember the cursor position while loading the
desktop.
* Modified: The edpecs.cc calls. Now it have a separated header and some
functions that are commonly used. It makes the code more compact and
readable.

Revision 1.372  2001/09/05 01:43:28  set
* Fixed: The option to open only the editor indicated in command line was
broken.

Revision 1.371  2001/09/04 19:54:40  set
* Added: Syntax highlight for "Cascading Style Sheets v2" contributed by
S. M. Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* Added: Syntax highlight for "JavaScript" contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* Added: Syntax highlight for "PostScript" contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* Added: More tags to the HTML syntax highlight contributed by S. M.
Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.

Revision 1.370  2001/09/04 19:27:19  set
* Fixed: [Win32+BC++] Inserted call to EmptyClipboard in the function that
sets data in the windows clipboard. Without this call data set by editor
was not seen by other application.  It happened because we did not set
editor as the clipboard owner. Call to EmptyClipboard does this. It only
applies to Win32 target, patch from Anatoli Soltan <anatoli@iname.com>.
* Modified: The behavior of Paste from Win Clipboard to be consistent with
what a regular windows user would expect.  Now it just does not copy the
previous selection to the clipboard and selects the pasted text only if
persistent blocks are enabled. Patch from Anatoli Soltan
<anatoli@iname.com>.

Revision 1.369  2001/09/04 18:04:04  set
* Modified: Now the default color for reserved words is light blue over
blue and not green over blue.
* Fixed: It was impossible to use CFLAGS options that contained
option=value because it confused patchenv.pl failing to configure the
makefiles. Reported by Norberto Alfredo Bensa <nbensa@hotmail.com>

Revision 1.368  2001/09/04 03:49:23  set
* Added: The TColorSelector::mark to the codepage remapper. It wasn't
available before.

Revision 1.367  2001/09/04 00:16:18  set
* Added: A new color in the palette for the disabled clusters. Also added
to the load process that if the palette we are loading doesn't have this
color it is initialized to a default. So:
* Modified: Version to 0.4.46.
* Added: Now we can specify that one of the error parsers defined in the
errors.cle file is the internal one. It should be used to use the internal
GNU parser instead of the defined in the file. Why? is much more faster and
supports internationalization.
* Modified: Syntax Highlight file to reflect it.
* Modified: Copyright dates in readme files and about dialogs.
* Added: A button to the file open/save/etc dialog to configure the sorting
options.
* Added: The new options to hide .*/*~/*.bkp and sort .* to the end to the
dialog to configure the file open dialog.
* Fixed: The above mentioned dialog was broken when I created the 32 bits
clusters and generated SIGSEGVs.
* Fixed: The patch I did to avoid crashes when no CLE files were available
disabled the other parsers.
* Fixed: The generic error parsers some times added an extra / generating
file names with to consecutive / (invalid for UNIX).

Revision 1.366  2001/09/03 17:44:10  set
* Added: Documentation for the new Run Program options.
* Modified: Now words in italic are represented enclosed by `' in the text
and info outputs.

Revision 1.365  2001/09/02 00:33:59  set
* Fixed: If no default options file was defined the default mask used to
reset modes was just 16 bits and not 32 clearing "Use indent size",
"Don't purge spaces" and "Backspace unindents". So they failed to be
transfered from global to local options.

Revision 1.364  2001/09/02 00:07:08  set
* Fixed: [Linux] A bug in the use of putenv, it made the editor fail to
detect the /tmp dir. As a result the editor created temporal files in the
current directory.

Revision 1.363  2001/09/01 23:25:36  set
* Added: A warning message if when the user tries to exit the child still
running or we still parsing the errors. If the user wants to exit anyways
the editor first stops it.

Revision 1.362  2001/09/01 23:03:55  set
* Added: Status line shortcuts for the Message Window (in the 3 menu files
and in editmenu.cc).
* Fixed: Now Prev/Next message are enabled only if the Message Window
really have lines to jump to.
* Added: [Linux] The run external program option now can run the program
in background. It can optionally disabled by the user.
* Added: The background process can be stopped just selecting the Message
Window and pressing Ctrl+C. The status line indicates if that's available
or not (the process is running or we still parsing their output).
* Added: Now the messages/errors from the external program can be parsed
in background. Is slower but you can continue working. That's the default
when the command runs in parallel, but can be enabled even if the process
will block the editor.
* Added: Options to configure how often the Message Window is updated when
the messages are parsed in parallel with the child program (the parameter
is how many lines are processed before releasing the CPU to poll input
devices). Also to configure if the window is forced to scroll or not.
* Updated: The spanish translation.
* Fixed: The new bufun.cc option to browse the functions didn't update the
special lines arrays.
* Modified: The interface to show messages in the Message Window to add all
of this gadgets. I wrote an equivalent in rhideint.cc I hope it won't break
RHIDE.
* Fixed: Now the Message Window only scrolls to the first line only if we
collected lines to jump. It was the original idea but was wrongly
implemented.
* Added: Dialogs to avoid the user running a second child process in:
Run External Program, SDG and Grep. Sure I missed something ;-)
* Fixed: Internationalized some messages I forgot while coding.
* Modified: Now is possible to enter comands upto 256 characters long in
the run external program dialog (was 80).
* Fixed: When running `make' as the external program the editor keeps track
of the various directory changes that makes does (nested makefiles). That's
needed for programs that reports errors giving relative names. The problem
was that when using spanish messages the editor got confused. Now the
editor tries with english and if it fails tries translating it. Currently
only english and spanish are supported but that's done with the .mo file
so any language can be supported without recompiling.
* Fixed: The GNU errors parsed was fulled by some gcc messages like it:
In file included by .....:line:\n
Now those lines are discarded.

Revision 1.361  2001/08/31 19:32:09  set
* Modified: Now if the terminal have a fixed code page that we know and
can't be changed then the editor disables the recoding mechanism. That's
true for terminals like xterm (enhanced VT100).

Revision 1.360  2001/08/31 19:30:01  set
* Added: Perl function parser to the bufun.cc mechanism. Also added more
information to the bufun.h file.

Revision 1.359  2001/08/29 23:41:50  set
* Added: A shell option to the Linux version. I ever thinked it wasn't a
good idea but a user asked for it. Sugested by David Xu
<davidx@viasoft.com.cn>.

Revision 1.358  2001/08/29 20:31:25  set
* Modified: Now when a file that was stored in the desktop file no longer
exists the editor doesn't open an empty window. Sugested by Martijn
Versteegh <m.versteegh@hccnet.nl>

Revision 1.357  2001/08/29 16:39:42  set
* Added: Now is possible to specify the Turbo Vision library and includes
path as parameters for the configuration script. That's useful for systems
with prefixes like /opt. Sugested by Joel Soete <joel.soete@freebel.net>.

Revision 1.356  2001/08/29 00:40:50  set
* Fixed: When jumping to another manpage double clicking the name of the
new one the window didn't update their title.
* Fixed: A bug introduce in the last changes to the manpage viewer. I was
releasing twice the name of the temporary stderr file (because librhtv
deletes it internally).

Revision 1.355  2001/08/28 18:37:24  set
* Added: Sources of gettext 0.10.39 configured to avoid libiconv. They are
intended for DOS users that doesn't have gettext installed or want to get a
much smaller executable (like me). I decided it after a discussion in the
djgpp-workers list, even the DOS porter of gettext Juan Manuel Guerrero
<st001906@hrz1.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de> sugested it for the editor's case.
.
Revision 1.354  2001/08/28 14:32:16  set
* Added: Support for gettext 0.10.37 and newer that needs libiconv. I tested
it with 0.10.39 and 1.7. Even when that's supported the result is quite bad,
for the DOS target the binary grows 829 Kb and when compressed 614 Kb. That's
unacceptable. The size of the compressed editor is currently about 480 Kb and
grows to 1094 Kb.
.
Revision 1.353  2001/08/27 20:37:06  set
* Modified: Removed the bufun.h inclusion in ced_exte.h to reduce
dependencies.
* Fixed: If the errors.cle file wasn't there the editor crashed when you run
external programs. Reported by Grzegorz.
.
Revision 1.352  2001/08/27 19:37:44  set
* Modified: I moved all the bufun.cc definitions to an independent header
called bufun.h. Also renamed the buffers and exported them so other parsers
can reuse it.
* Added: Now the Clipper parser detects the last line of functions and also
adds information to the name indicating if the function is a procedure and
if the static qualifier was used.
.
Revision 1.351  2001/08/26 00:36:52  set
* Added: Now the jump to function mechanism (bufun.cc) can support languages
other than C/C++. I added Clipper support and Grzegorz is working on a LaTex
parser.
.
Revision 1.350  2001/08/16 01:28:18  set
* Added: A patch to avoid problems when including ced_clas.h twice. From
Robert.
* Fixed: A problem in the libset library used by RHIDE. Now rhideint.cc
must provide EdJumpToMessage(), currently is just a dummy.

Revision 1.349  2001/08/14 22:56:21  set
* Added: A comment about buggy GeForce BIOSes in the Win/DOS FAQ. They seems
to have similar bugs to Matrox BIOSes. Thanks to Andy <Bitland@aol.com>.
* Added: A button to the function list called "Browse". It sends the list of
functions to the message window sorted alphabetically or by line number and
then you can browse the source code jumping from function to function.
Sugested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>.
It added a new parameter to SelectFunctionToJump.
* Added: Now when the user have one central desktop file the editor makes a
back-up of it before writing a new one. This is quite useful for Windows
systems that likes to crash and corrupt files. Sugested by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
.
Revision 1.348  2001/08/14 17:51:12  set
* Fixed: InfView's search dialog was broken due to aligment in the
TFindInfDialogRec structure. Now is marked with pack(1) to avoid it, I guess
that's something new with gcc 2.95.x.
.
Revision 1.347  2001/08/14 00:56:24  set
* Fixed: [Linux] When a manpage didn't exist Linux's man outputs to stderr
a message. In the past the editor missed it giving no help to the user and
also letting an error file in the home directory. Now stderr is also
redirected and if stdout is empty stderr is shown. Reported by
"GiBa" <giba@lacasilla.com.ar>.
* Fixed: utod.pl again.
* Modified: The makefile so makes/linux/compress.pl doesn't need to be
executable (CVS likes to forget it because my CVS in a fat32 partition).

Revision 1.346  2001/08/13 23:16:50  set
* Fixed: A bug in "Intelligent C indent". A parenthesis after a / was not
counted leading to wrong indentation. I hope the new code really fixed it
without breaking other detail.
.
Revision 1.345  2001/08/13 22:38:37  set
* Modified: To make recode happy now the CP850 files are ever converted to
DOS format (not only in Linux). I made utod.pl more reliable too.
* Added: SHL for .po files.
* Added: German translations, thanks to Oliver Schieche
<oliver.schieche@d2mail.de>. Also added it to the Linux and DOS distribution
and to the installer (was tricky).
* Added: All the Turbo Vision messages to the translations, so I updated the
spanish translation.
* Fixed: The message window scrolled horizontally only 255 columns and lines
are allowed to be 1000 columns (then are wrapped). So now you can fully
scroll upto 1000 columns.
.
Revision 1.344  2001/08/13 18:13:21  set
* Added: Preload to C/C++, Perl and Makefile SHLs.
* Added: Objetive C and PDP 11 assembler SHLs contributed by Beni Cherniavsky
<cben@crosswinds.net>.
* Added: Preload keyword to the .shl SHL.
* Added: The Emacs mode for .frt files as "sdg", also added to a couple of
.frt files because they generate files with "texinfo" markers confusing the
editor.
* Added: link and mailto commands to the html.frt as sugested by Florian
Xaver.
.
Revision 1.343  2001/08/13 17:30:24  set
* Modified: Now the keywords of the syntax highlights aren't loaded at
start-up, intead they are loaded on demand. The keywords and the search
tables are the most memory consuming parts of the syntax highlight structure.
* Added: A Preload keyword to force the most commonly used SHL keywords to be
loaded at start-up.
* Fixed: Added to the distribution a file I forgot in the upload of the last
beta.
.
Revision 1.342  2001/08/12 17:50:39  set
* Compiled with BC++ 5.5:
* Added: A comment in BC++ 5.5 port making explicit where should be TV
located.
* Fixed: A use of variable size array in ceditor.cc (AllocLocalStr now)
(Win32).
* Fixed: Use of strcasecmp without Uses_string (Win32).
.
Revision 1.341  2001/08/12 16:07:46  set
* Merged patches from Andris addressing compiling issues when using gcc 2.97
and newer releases:
1) #endif at the end of files must have a new line character at the end.
2) strlen and other internal functions now needs #include <string.h>
3) The need for ## concatenation in macros is no longer needed when symbols
are around the variable and now is deprecated. I left the old code (disabled)
just in case it breaks very old gcc releases so we can just make it
conditional.
4) Is no longer valid to cast a pointer to a smaller integer, so now two
consecutive casts are needed, one to convert the pointer into an integer and
another to cut down the integer. This is used in the keyboard routines where
collections uses void * to store 16 bits unsigned values.
* Added: Support for ".inf.gz" extension (from Andris patch)
.
Revision 1.340  2001/08/11 01:40:17  set
* Added: CommentIndent command, it indents a block with the EOLCom1
definition. Sugested by Thiago.
* Added: CommentUnIndent, it unindents a block using the length of EOLCom1 as
reference. Sugested by Thiago.
* Fixed: UnIndentBlock failed to update the syntax highlight, it was clear
after removing the comments in the block.
* Fixed: The undo of the arbitrary indent used the starting selection instead
of the final one generating problems for long blocks.
.
Revision 1.339  2001/08/10 02:50:36  set
* Added: sLisp commands:
  OpenFile: opens a file as a new window. (Asked by "Thiago F.G. Albuquerque"
            <tfga@zaz.com.br>)
  length: returns the length of a string.
  strcasecmp/strcmp: compares strings.
  Operator -: for integers.
* Added: these new commands to the syntax highlight and documentation (also
strstr).
.
Revision 1.338  2001/08/05 23:35:46  set
* Modified: The way the PREFIX is passed to the compress scripts to allow
the main makefile to generate the distribution. It should be reworked.
.
Revision 1.337  2001/08/04 23:41:01  set
* Added: New configuration option to avoid using FHS structure and set it
for my configuration.
* Added: Distribution targets to the main makefile they pass the FHS
options to the makes/Makefile.
* Modified: The way the es_iso.po file is created to avoid stupid problems
from recode. The recode and gettext are generating problems all the time.

Revision 1.336  2000/12/09 21:32:42  set
* Merged changes from Anatoli for the BC++ configuration process. Also makes
pmacros files support DOS format in UNIX.
* Added: Comments in the FAQ about Cirrus boards that have problems under W9x
* Updated: the WinNT/readme.txt file to reflect the actual process.
* Fixed: The 'D' shortcut was used twice in the redmond.smn for the File
menu. Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Added: A dialog asking if a compressed file saved with "save as" should be
also saved compressed. Reported by Gregorio.
* Added: A TODO file.
* Fixed: More conflicts between gettext and conio.
* Fixed: Now when closing a project the window title (of the application)
reverts to "No project loaded". Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Fixed: Compilation problems when PCRE wasn't available.
.
Revision 1.335  2000/08/09 23:30:23  root
* Fixed: The editor didn't preserve the UID/GID of files when creating
back-ups.
* Fixed: When loading some old desktop files with black palettes (created by
some really old versions of the editor) you got a black screen. Now the editor
checks for such a silly situation and reverts to the default palette.
.
Revision 1.334  2000/06/27 02:37:03  set
* Modified: Now using gettext 0.10.35.
* Modified: Now using RHIDE 1.4.7.6.
.
Revision 1.333  2000/06/27 01:16:08  set
* Fixed: Some pmacros needed "back space unindents" *NHP*.
* Modified: Now using bzip2 v1.0, it is supposed to be more bullet-proof when
uncompressing garbage. Thanks god I included it directly because the
function names changed from 0.x to 1.0 (added BZ2_ prefix).

Revision 1.332  2000/06/13 23:36:49  set
* Added: Warning about Creative PCI boards not supported by Allegro.
* Modified: TMixDiag constructor to avoid calling gettext inlined because
gcc 2.95.2 doesn't like it. I suspect that's a bug in gcc because 2.7.x and
2.8.x doesn't reject it.
* Added: A desktop lock while parsing the errors output from external
programs to reduce the redraw. Linux's frame buffer is poorly implemented and
have a really bad performance producing amazingly huge delays. Reported by
Grzegorz.
.
Revision 1.331  2000/06/06 00:49:03  root (set)
* Added: A check and warning for/by makeinfo during configuration.

Revision 1.330  2000/06/06 00:41:40  root (set)
* Added: A check for xgettext in the configuration script and a warning if
recode isn't installed.

Revision 1.329  2000/06/06 00:19:36  root (set)
* Fixed: Now the configure tells if recode wasn't found.
* Fixed: Warning in menuload.cc with gcc 2.7.2.3.
* Ignored doc/Makefile in the CVS.

Revision 1.328  2000/06/04 18:37:36  set
* Added: Now all modes are supported in the Mode setence used by the pmacros.
* Added: Now the $if command supports and/or operators for menu files.
* Added: The MP3 list can be loaded/saved as a WinAmp M3U list.
.
Revision 1.327  2000/05/25 19:12:56  set
* Added: An option to configure the BC++ port to generate a dynamic/static
executable.
* Fixed: Now when passing a list of files to grep the filenames are quoted to
avoid problems with file names containing spaces. Reported by Grzegorz.
* Modified: The check to see if grep is installed. It now checks for GNU grep
to avoid problems with other implementations. In particular Inprise version
that is quite far from POSIX.
* Warning: I discovered that BC++ and MingW libraries have a really buggy
system function, it can just crash Windows 95 misserably when passing long
command lines, lets say 3.5 Kb. It can affect the editor stability.
.
Revision 1.326  2000/05/25 15:21:33  set
* Added: Now the configure mechanism generates the BC++ makefiles. With it
all the targets now uses the information found in the .gpr files to compile.
It means I just need to keep updated the list of files to include in the
distribution, all the other makefiles are generated from RHIDE's projects
(djgpp/Linux/Win32 directly and BC++ indirectly).
.
Revision 1.325  2000/05/22 23:49:30  set
* New: Now the MingW port uses the same makefiles than the DOS and Linux
targets. It means this port will be quite updated without taking special
care.
* Modified: Now the configure script doesn't overwrite the configed.h file if
it wasn't changed. That's good to avoid a masive recompile when it isn't in
fact needed.
* Updated: The configuration library with changes in the TV version of it.
* Added: A mechanism to change more variables in RHIDE makefiles from the
configure script.
* Fixed: EasyDiag's TSTextScroller size.
* Modified: Now the about box have a TSTextScroller because I added thanks to
Vadim and Anatoli.
.
Revision 1.324  2000/05/20 13:19:03  set
* New: Now thanks to changes from Anatoli Soltan merged in TV the exe
generated with BC++ runs under Win95 and NT.
* Added: Configuration mechanism to support the new syntax of recode 3.5. It
also allows to make the editor in machines without recode.
* Added: Code to the configuration library to generate makefiles from
templates of makefiles doing some search & replace.
* Merged small changes from Anantoli Soltan to the BC++ makefiles. They allow
creating the help file (makeinfo for Win32 is shipped) and installing the
compiled files.
* Added: A couple of new pmacros to Clipper.
* Fixed: The BC++ errors parsing definition (errors.cle).
* Fixed: A table in the manual (strftime options).
* Fixed: Now sdh.c uses getcwd (no getwd) because (a) getwd is deprecated (I
saw it in Linux and Oswald Buddenhagen <ob6@inf.tu-dresden.de> asked to fix
it) and (b) getwd doesn't exist for BC++ so Anatoli sent patches to replace
it. Now the compatlayer is used for it.
* Fixed: The generation of .html files from the .txt ones. Now < and > are
replaced. Reported by Neil Parks <nparks@torah.org>.
* Fixed: When following a list of errors/hits with Alt+F8 in some cases the
previous hit wasn't cleared.
.
Revision 1.323  2000/05/17 23:09:36  set
* Modified: Some details in EasyDiag: OK+Cancel buttons to work in growable
dialogs and xTSRight,xTSLeft and xTSLeftOf calculations (hope nothing got
screwed).
* Modified: Now the list of functions lists members like this "member
(class)" instead of C++ syntax "class::member". It makes the incremental
search much more simple.
* Modified: The list of functions and list of windows now have horizontal
scroll bar. Also: they are EasyDiag dialogs now.
.
Revision 1.322  2000/05/16 02:10:23  set
* Fixed: A crash when deleting all the items (and one more ;-) in the MP3
list. Only happend if you did it very quickly.
* Added: An horizontal scroll bar to the MP3 list dialog.
* Added: Now easydiag list boxes can have two scroll bars. I modified TV a
little bit to make it easier.
.
Revision 1.321  2000/05/16 00:17:29  set
* Fixed: The error pattern description for Borland C compilers. Now it works
for BC++ 5.5. Grzegorz reported problems and I fixed it.
* Added: clear keyword to the HTML syntax. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Fixed: The syntax hl for shell scripts needed EscapeAnywhere=1. Reported by
Grzegorz.
* Added: SQL syntax. Contributed by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Fixed: The editor added read-only copies to the list of closed windows when
closing one of them. It produced a crash when opening the file from the
closed list. Reported by Volker Kiefel"<volker.kiefel@med.uni-rostock.de>.
.
Revision 1.320  2000/05/15 01:00:28  root (set)
* Added: Palette support to the Linux version. Also changed the palette
values to be 0-255 instead of 0-63 to be more generic. Lamentably it looks
like Linux people forgot to add a get palette sequence, is that correct? if
all half done?

Revision 1.319  2000/05/13 19:58:38  set
* Added: A new option that forces the editor to do the match pair 'on the
fly' without waiting for idle. Suggested by Oswald Buddenhagen
<ob6@inf.tu-dresden.de>.
* Modified: Now backspace behavior is not tied to the Real Tabs option. It
have your own option. It was suggested by others in the past but Oswald
finally made me do it ;-)
* Updated: The documentation to reflect all the new modes.
* Modified: accehtml.cc line 31 to workaround a bug in egcs (doesn't like
calls to static members specifying an object!).
* Fixed: Now if you have two functions with the same name SDG will list both
in the index. Reported by Gregorio.
* Modified: Version to 0.4.45.
.
Revision 1.318  2000/05/12 23:16:40  root (set)
* Fixed: The configure script was looking for the dinamic TV when static was
specified.
* Fixed: infbase.cc request of filelength.

Revision 1.317  2000/05/12 02:19:46  set
* Incorporated the Win9x and WinNT versions. The WinNT version was introduced
thanks to Anatoli Soltan <anatoli@iname.com> and is for BC++ 5.5 compiler.
* Moved some stuff to a new library (part of TV now) and will move even more
things. The idea is to avoid an excess of conditionals. This introduced
changes in almost all sources.
* Adapted to compile with MingW32 for Win32.
.
Revision 1.316  2000/04/29 17:55:05  root (set)
* Modified: Gave 2 more rows for the mixer sliders.
* Modified: Added more description to the mixer name.

Revision 1.315  2000/04/29 17:04:55  set
* Added: Board level sound mixer. As this is something I want and not all the
people seems to agree that this is desirable I added options to: (a) disable
it at compilation time (HAVE_MIXER and --without-mixer) and (b) a run time
option (command line --no-mixer). Under DOS only SB Pro and SB 16 compatible
mixers are supported. Under Linux OSS mixer is supported. The values can be
optionally stored in the desktop file.
* Changed: I synchronized the configuration library with the one used by TV.
* Added: A new EasyDiag object called TSSlider. Is used for the volume
settings in the mixer's dialog.
* Fixed: A GPF when the editor was stopped during a list play operation and
it was restored in another run.
* Fixed: A small detail in mpegsound from 0.8.3 new version.
.
Revision 1.314  2000/04/20 19:16:19  set
* Added: </li keyword to HTML syntax. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Added: A new option: Don't purge spaces. When enabled the spaces at the end
of lines aren't automafically deleted by the editor. Suggested by Martijn
Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>, wasn't the first user.
* Added: Warning about bugs in xgettext in the makefile.
* Updated: The spanish traslation.
.
Revision 1.313  2000/04/16 20:17:03  root (set)
* Added: MP3 support to the Linux version.

Revision 1.312  2000/04/16 18:23:34  set
* Added: A new library for MP3 files. That's the library used by Linux's
splay. I added support for MP3s inside wavs, damaged MP3 files, VBR encoded
files and more to this code. Users should consider it under test.
* Added: The mpegsound library to the configuration process. I keep libamp
and is possible to choose between the two engines.
* Fixed: The use of 2 sets of flags in the .mak files (one from the
RHIDE_OS_FLAGS and the other from CFLAGS).
* Added: A set of C/C++ flags for parts of the project that needs strong
optimization, like the MP3 engines.
* Fixed: Some problems with the version of the information stored for closed
files. It wasn't present in releases, just in WIP versions.
* Fixed: Bug in relative paths interpretation of the code that parses
messages from external programs.

Revision 1.311  2000/04/13 00:37:46  root (set)
* Updated: .gpr file and sources for the new TV dependencies (tv/...).
* Updated: version.txt file.

Revision 1.310  2000/02/27 20:14:19  set
* Added: Now tab size, indent size and wrap column are stored for closed
files and project items.
* Fixed: InfView now doesn't hang if the node can't be found.
* Added: InfView now looks in all the file if the node isn't found in the
first try. It helps for handedited/damaged info files I saw it in files that
David Cabanillas Barbacil <davidc@ibernet.com> sent me (GPC help files).
.
Revision 1.309  2000/02/27 18:52:13  set
* Added: Yet another tab option: Now is possible to indent using spaces but
also using an indentation ammount different than the tab size. The new option
is called "Use indent size" and you can also configure the value of "indent
size". In this way is possible to code like Allegro's guidelines say:
"Basic Allegro style: K&R, with 3 space indentation. On disk, though, tab
stops are 8 spaces, so if for example a line was indented by 12 spaces, this
would be saved out as either 12 space characters or 1 tab and 4 spaces, not
as 4 tabs.". It was proposed by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.
* Modified: As a result of these new settings now we have 17 global flags, it
overflowed the traditional TV limit of 16 bits. To overcome it I added a 32
bits version of radio buttons and check boxes to TV. It isn't the final
solution because I think these dialogs really need a new layout. Anyways, as
I think 32 bits is more suitable for gcc now the editor uses 32 bits options
in all places. To achieve it I was forced to modify a lot of structures and
dialogs. Tested most of them, I hope no bugs were introduced.
* Modified: As a result of this I did a cleaning job in the editor dialogs. I
added some EasyDiag goodies: a new TSViewCol constructor that creates a
default dialog (that's the most common case), a variation of doIt that sets
the dialog as centered and configures the help context (doItCentered), a new
positioning option yTSUpSep it puts the object on top of the dialog but
letting some space between the frame and the object and multicolumn radio
buttons and check boxes. Now EasyDiag also defaults to 32 bits options, it
can be disabled defining Dont_Use_32Bits_Clusters. I also added a callback to
TV buttons and modified TSButton to reflect it. yTSUp was fixed.
* Modified: Version to 0.4.43.
.
Revision 1.308  2000/02/24 23:10:40  set
* Fixed: Applied some patches from Alex Lozano for EasyDiag. They fix
problems with xTSLeft and yTSOver (I don't usually use them). I applied one
of the patches with a small variant.
.
Revision 1.307  2000/02/23 00:31:22  set
* Added: A new option in Search & Replace, it shows the name of the function
where the match was found (only for C/C++ and if the match is inside).
Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Modified: Version to 0.4.42 (change in S&R flags).
.
Revision 1.306  2000/02/22 01:25:57  set
* Added: A new command called cmcWhichFunctionIs. It determines the name of
the function where the cursor is positioned. It isn't the fastest thing in
the world because it collects the list of all functions, but as bufun.cc is
really fast I think that's ok. It isn't associated to a key. I also commented
how the magic heuristic of bufun.cc works. This addition is the first step
to create a mechanism suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy.
.
Revision 1.305  2000/02/22 00:12:46  set
* Fixed: When using the match pair on the fly the editor always forced a line
flush even if the cursor weren't in a potential match. Now that's done only
if the cursor is over {, }, (, ), [ or ]. A side effect of this behavior was
reported as a bug by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.
.
Revision 1.304  2000/02/21 23:57:39  set
* Fixed: When loading .dst files older than 0.4.32 the memorized flags for
closed files were converted in the wrong way. Some times enabling the cross
cursor.
.
Revision 1.303  2000/02/21 23:21:49  set
* Fixed: Small typos in new documentation.
* Fixed: Uninitialized data in the cross cursor stuff that could generate
GPFs.
.
Revision 1.302  2000/02/13 21:48:02  set
* Added: a new command (LineOrScrEnd), that's 100% equivalent to VI's g-end.
The previously added (LastColInScreen) isn't 100% equal. The new one doesn't
go to the last column of the screen if the end of line is first. Information
provided by Leon <Leon@caresystems.com.au>.
.
Revision 1.301  2000/02/13 21:26:57  set
* Added: Now the calculator supports commas like in C code. Patch from
Burton. I also documented more details of the new calculator.
* Fixed: The >= of the calculator had a typo that prevented it to work.
.
Revision 1.300  2000/02/13 20:55:18  set
* Added: shtml files to the html syntax. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Added: Real support for Texinfo 4.0's Ref: references. They jump to the
correct node and positions the cursor at the right line.
* Added: Now is possible to have two files with the same file name in
projects if they are different files (from different directories). After some
talk with Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.299  2000/02/13 14:01:11  set
* Added: Now the list of functions takes the word under cursor including
colons. That's needed for C++. Suggested by Alex.
* Added: Now the list of functions is more cleaver and looks for C++ members
with the name of the word under cursor if no function with this name was
found.
* Fixed: Some potential GPF and fails to update the new entries in the user
words.
* Fixed: GPFs produced by the column and row cursors when the cursor was
outside the visible area.
.
Revision 1.298  2000/02/05 21:44:25  set
* Fixed: Some spelling errors (remmember, allready and latter). Reported by
Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de> and Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Added: Now double clicking in Alt+0 window is the same as pressing the Go
button. Suggested by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Fixed: ESC doesn't reset the palette to defaults in the palette dialog.
Reported by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Modified: Now the FileOpen dialog used in the project and MP3 list says
"Done" instead of "Cancel". Suggested by Waldemar Schultz
<schultz@ma.tum.de>.
.
Revision 1.297  2000/02/03 01:19:08  set
* Modified: The version of some tools I use in the README.
* Added: [Linux] Explanation to one posible source of "can't open terminal"
error in the FAQ.
* Fixed: [InfView] Now "Open InfView" works even if no InfView window is
opened. Reported by Ivan.
* Modified: All the needed places to support the new location of TV headers.
It changed the dependencies.
.
Revision 1.295  2000/01/26 00:41:53  set
* Added: Now InfView also looks for .info.bz2 and .bz2 files. So entering
(editor) InfView will try to load editor.bz2 and editor.info.bz2. Only when
bzip2 support is compiled.
.
Revision 1.294  2000/01/26 00:25:10  set
* Fixed: A small error in the MSVC errors parsing. Pointed out by Grzegorz.
* Added: Now the editor alters the W9x window title adding information about
the version and loaded project. That's what "Jeremy W. Murphy"
<jwm@amc.com.au> originally suggested. I do it in a way that it isn't
permanent, even if the program crashes.
.
Revision 1.293  2000/01/22 17:57:49  set
* Added: A new calculator parser from Burton Radons. It adds conditionals,
variables definitions and function definitions. The old parser and a small
version of this new one can be selected during configuration.
.
Revision 1.292  2000/01/20 00:55:20  set
* Updated: Copyrights for year 2000.
* Added: Copyright of bzip2 and knowledgement in the about box. Also for
Zlib.
* Added: Jump to last column, it could need some adjusts. Is supposed to be
the equivalent of g-end in VI. Suggested by Leon <Leon@caresystems.com.au>.
.
Revision 1.291  2000/01/18 00:01:42  set
* Added: Configurable status line. So now is possible to configure all the
keys used by the editor, specially Copy/Paste in input lines. Dean Limbaugh
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us> and Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de> were two of
the users that asked for it, I just don't remember the rest.
* Added: Transparent support for bzip2 compressed files. It works for regular
files and info files. The info file should have the same extension used by
gz. I know Mandrake uses bzip2 compressed info files but don't know the exact
name so I guess it will need some adjusts. It also means the executable is
larger. And the memory requirements for saving bzip2 files are big. I added
it after a report from Salazar <jsalaz3@almez.pntic.mec.es> talking about
problems with Mandrake 6.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.41 14th public release.

Revision 1.290  2000/01/02 19:31:56  set
*Fixed: Problems with project files. Reported by Ryan Owen <ryan@eyring.com>.
.
Revision 1.289  2000/01/02 16:40:06  set
* Adjustemnts to release v0.4.41.
.
Revision 1.288  1999/12/31 16:41:06  set
* Modified: more details to workaround bugs in makeinfo 4.0 related to the
Table Of Contents.
.
Revision 1.287  1999/12/31 15:16:22  set
* Added: A new menu option to save the project manually. Suggested by
"Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au>
.
Revision 1.286  1999/12/29 23:46:37  root (set)
* Fixed: Abort when pressing ENTER in the message window without items.

Revision 1.285  1999/12/29 23:25:27  root (set)
* Fixed: [Linux] A bug introduced in 1.209/10 revisions when saving files
in DOS format. Reported by Gregorio.

Revision 1.284  1999/12/29 00:56:53  set
* Added: Now the project window also says the name of the project file.
Suggested by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Applied: Changes to the Debian packaging files. Now the infview can be
generated as another package. From Ivan.

Revision 1.283  1999/12/21 23:49:11  root (set)
* Fixed: A bug in sLisp when handling strings with escape sequences
(\n, \t, etc.). Probably introduced in 1.187. Reported by Uwe Steinmann
<steinm@majestix.fernuni-hagen.de>.

Revision 1.282  1999/12/19 21:48:31  root (set)
* Added: Now you can pass extra command line options using an environment
variable called SET_CMDLINE.

Revision 1.281  1999/12/19 19:57:20  root (set)
* Added: Support for .info files created with texinfo 4.0 that includes Ref:
tags in the indirect table. I didn't investigate how they work but the files
can be used.
* Added: Support for makeinfo from texinfo 4.0 to generate the documentation.
I needed to fool makeinfo adding an extra @contents at the top of the txt
file, don't know why. Reported by Ivan who is using Potato (Debian 2.2).
* Added: New command line option +[line number], like in VI. Suggested by
Ivan, looks like some tools uses it, in this way we can just replace VI by
SETEdit when using these tools.

Revision 1.280  1999/12/05 16:16:42  root (set)
* Added: Now when calling the man page viewer the editor offers the word
under cursor as man page.

Revision 1.279  1999/12/05 15:34:18  root (set)
* Modified: Version to 0.4.41.
* Fixed: [Linux] When switching from hidden to normal desktop files the
editor left the hidden version of the desktop file generating potential
confusions. Now the hidden file is removed. That's i just another annoyiance
of the silly hidden files mechanism.
* Modified: [DOS] Now the editor also looks for HOME and HOMEDIR when loading
configuration files. Also: the directory where the exe is located is the one
looked at last.
.
Revision 1.278  1999/11/30 00:25:25  set
* Fixed: The ~K~eep short-cut in the SDG options was used for O~K~. Reported
by Gregorio.
* Modified: Now the message window shows ^M if the line contains /r.
.
Revision 1.277  1999/11/29 23:33:31  set
* Fixed: GPF/SIGSEGV when using BackSpace in the functions list to delete the
first letter in the incremental search. Reported by Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.276  1999/11/21 21:25:58  set
* Added: Configurable mechanism to parse the errors collected from an
external application. It uses Perl RegEx to do the job. Suggested by
Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.275  1999/11/21 14:37:44  set
* Added: A new shl flag "EscapeAnywhere" this switch makes the editor parse
the escape character outside strings.
.
Revision 1.274  1999/11/21 12:49:57  set
* Changed: The way the INFOPATH is guessed under DOS. A djgpp user installed
the editor outside the djgpp tree and then the editor used INFOPATH but
failed to find the setedit.inf file. Now the editor also adds your tree even
if INFOPATH is defined. Reported by Sylvia <smlew@ifocus.com.sg>.
.
Revision 1.273  1999/11/20 15:28:44  set
* Fixed: When inserting items to the project the editor used the *.epr mask
instead of the one used to open regular files. Reported by Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.272  1999/11/20 14:41:23  set
* Added: Syntax highlight for PLM/51 contributed by Jari Korhonen
<jari.korhonen@ponsse.fi>. (Intel's long-gone not-so-highlevel language for
8051 CPUs).
.
Revision 1.271  1999/11/05 00:28:59  set
* Fixed: [DOS] Compilation problems with gcc 2.95 in the plasma stuff.
* Added: [Linux] ISO-8859-1 spanish messages.
.
Revision 1.270  1999/10/30 20:50:55  root (set)
* Added: Spanish messages to Linux distribution, that's the first try and
needs more work.

Revision 1.269  1999/10/30 15:30:38  root (set)
* Added: A command line switch to specify files to load from an external list
of files where each line is a file. Suggested by SpaZe.

Revision 1.268  1999/10/30 14:51:41  root (set)
* Added: New command line switches to the --help help and the man page.

Revision 1.267  1999/10/30 14:40:57  root (set)
* Modified: Now if you use "load only specified files" the editor doesn't
really load the files to then close'm like before. Now the TCEditor class
have a special flag to simulate the load without actually loading the file
content. Only the InfView windows are actually loaded. It makes things
faster.
* Added: Three command line switches: --tile-vert, --tile-horiz and --cascade
to make these operations after loading the files from the desktop file or
named in the command line. Suggested by Spaze.

Revision 1.266  1999/10/30 13:34:38  root (set)
* Modified: Now the new option to search the word when you press ^F1 inside
the node takes the visible name you choose from the list and not the word
under cursor. Suggested by Gregorio.

Revision 1.265  1999/10/29 01:48:14  root (set)

* Added: The reverse operation for "HTML accents". Suggested by Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.263  1999/10/26 00:04:43  set
* Added: [Linux] Now the convert HTML accents feature also works in Linux,
was just matter of enabling it.
* Added: Now the file open dialog is resizeble. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Modified: [Linux] Now the editor disables the Xon/Xoff mode of the terminal
so ^Q/^S aren't used for it. It enables the use of ^Q and ^S when running in
an Xterm, Eterm, etc.
.
Revision 1.262  1999/10/23 19:50:08  set
* Added: Yet another tab mode. "Tab indents", it is by default enabled
because that's what the editor ever did. Disabling it the editor will behave
like when using tabs but will insert spaces instead of tabs.
.
Revision 1.261  1999/10/23 18:51:04  set
* Fixed: Crashes when starting the editor and it was playing an MP3 file that
don't exists anymore.

.
Revision 1.258  1999/10/16 01:13:04  set
* Added: An option to make InfView search the word under cursor when you did
a syntax search, but inside the selected topic. Hmmm... how to explain it,
just use ^F1 and see. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>

and spanish translation. Also added the other indentation commands to the
menu.
.
Revision 1.256  1999/10/14 01:17:33  root
* Removed the libamp from the Linux distribution, it isn't needed and the
copyright could produce some confusion.
* Fixed: I forgot to add infview.mak to the list of makefiles to patch.
* Fixed: A multiline crossreference in the documentation.

* Added: Redraw command to the editor (in menu and documented).
* Updated: Debian files (from Ivan).
* Documented: sLisp AskString.

the cursor position. Ivan asked for such an option from the menu.
* Added: Now the sLisp InsertText function doesn't allow the insertion of
text with \n and not \r\n under DOS (not well tested).

Revision 1.251  1999/10/10 21:43:08  set

* Added: When an external program returns errors the editor jumps to the
first line in the message window. Also, the editor adds a message to know the
control is back again in the editor.
.
Revision 1.250  1999/10/10 14:47:54  set

.
Revision 1.248  1999/10/02 18:51:19  set
* Added: New sLisp command ShortFileName. Needed to pass SFNs to external

* Fixed: A lot of warnings from gcc 2.95, don't know if all (const missing
type, char * not const, assembler clobber lists, etc.).
* Added: Now the code page remapping routines converts symbols not found in
the destination code page to similar ones. Example: accented letter to same
letter not accented. It works for latin symbols, now I'm waiting for
Alexander's tables for cyrilic symbols.
.
Revision 1.246  1999/09/30 02:58:16  set
* Added: Code page remaping. It should work for all the supported code pages.
Documented, added to menues, translated to spanish, etc. I was thinking about
adding it because I write some mails in DOS and then Alexander Bokovoy asked
for it (for russian code pages, they are a mess). The last settings are
stored in the desktop file so new version 0.4.37.
.
Revision 1.245  1999/09/29 00:39:39  set
* Added: A new editor command called cmcCutClipWin to cut text to Windows
clipboard. Suggested by Spaze. I also mention it in the documentation and
give an example in redmond.smn about how to use the Windows clipboard instead
of the internal one.
.
Revision 1.244  1999/09/29 00:08:02  set
* Added: The emu387.dxe emulator so the editor can be installed in systems
without coprocessor. Suggested and tested by "Eathan Clark"
<eathan@cableone.net>.
.
Revision 1.243  1999/09/28 23:20:29  root (set)
* Fixed: Now if the message window is outside the screen that's fixed at load
time. I don't really know the reason for it but Gregorio and me experimented
it. Is something related with running the editor with different screen
resolutions. Reported by Gregorio.

Revision 1.242  1999/09/28 23:06:39  root (set)
* Fixed: [Linux] Paste in input likes failed. Reported by Ivan.
* Fixed: When pasting in input lines not all the text was selected and the
cursor wasn't well positioned.
* Fixed: The new special character shl feature wasn't parsed by the
multilines parser, only for the painting parser. Reported by "FireEgl
(Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Added: Now if you double click over name(section) construction in a man
page window the editor jumps to this manpage. Suggested by Ivan.

Revision 1.241  1999/09/28 03:32:55  root (set)
* Fixed: configure mechanism wasn't setting the static/dynamic exe correctly.
* Removed debian/rhide.env from CVS and makes/lista.

Revision 1.240  1999/09/28 03:03:07  root (set)
* Applied patches for the Debian package from Ivan.
* Fixed: The editor was creating a tcedit.dst file in /usr/share/setedit if
you selected to save only one centralized file. That isn't correct, this
directory could be read-only. If you want default options to be global for all
the users you can copy tcedit.dst to /usr/share/setedit, but the editor won't
save there; the HOME directory will be used instead. Reported by Ivan.
* Fixed: debian/doc-base was missing in the distribution.
* Fixed: Compilation problems with glibc 2.1.2 because the use of __USE_GNU
instead of _GNU_SOURCE. Patch from Ivan.

Revision 1.239  1999/09/26 20:30:43  set
* Added: Jump to prototype command. That's very similar to jump to function.
Suggested by Pavlos.
.
Revision 1.238  1999/09/26 16:34:58  set
* Added: MP3's ID3 genre field to the MP3 dialog. "Pavlos" <gtoub@otenet.gr>
provided the first 100 names and I added another 42 from WinAmp 1.90.
.
Revision 1.237  1999/09/26 15:15:35  set
* Documented: The new match directives for SHL.
* Added: A rudimentary SHL for Makefiles.
.
Revision 1.236  1999/09/26 14:35:08  set
* Added: Conditional compilation for PCRE>=2.0 and <=2.05 from the configure
script (was present manually).
* Added: Now is possible to associate a SHL with a file name using regular
expressions (PCREs). You can give regex to match the file name or the whole
path+name. It is needed for things like makefiles and was asked by Ivan and
Gregorio. (NameMatch and FullNameMatch).
* Modified: Now the configure script for Linux can take any amount of
parameters. Patch by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.235  1999/09/25 20:46:16  set
* Fixed: An error in the configure script, it wasn't saving the version of
the detected zlib (the code tested instead ;-))
* Fixed: When adding new user words they wasn't visible until the next
redraw, that's forced now.
* Fixed: It was posible to save a block with the name of an opened file. Even
when the editor issued a warning about overwriting a file it could have bad
side effects.
.
Revision 1.234  1999/09/25 19:30:07  set
* Added: Now is possible to indicate that EOLComment1 must be in the first
column and EOLComment2 don't.
* Added: Now is also possible to tell to the editor that an EOLComment is
valid if it's located in the first non-blank character. Seems to be needed
for TCL. Suggested by "FireEgl (Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
.
Revision 1.233  1999/09/25 18:01:51  set
* Fixed: [DOS] A bug in djgpp v2.02 libc system() function that left child
exes opened leaking file handles and preventing external compilers to
overwrite the file. It only happened for non-djgpp programs. "Andreas
Leidner" <leidner@gmx.net>.
.
Revision 1.232  1999/09/25 16:52:49  set
* Fixed: One define in windoldap.h file. Reported by Pavlos.
* Fixed: An egcs warning (egcs bug) reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* Fixed: [DOS] Wrong manifest file name for InfView. Reported by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
* Fixed: Two typos (asigNment). Reported by Spaze.
* Fixed: The "Test" button in screen savers dialog only worked if the screen
saver was ON before entering in the dialog. Reported by Spaze.
* Fixed: Wrong width of the dialog to choose a command. Reported by Spaze.
.
Revision 1.231  1999/09/25 16:34:57  root
* Fixed: [Linux] The editor was creating userwords.txt and default settings
in /usr/share/setedit instead of user's home. Reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* Fixed: [Linux] SIGSEGVs when using hidden desktop files. Reported by Ilker
Aksen <Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.

Revision 1.230  1999/09/25 14:31:02  set
* Fixed: When Match Pair and Wrap Columns were enabled and the match happened
in the wrap column the editor did really stupid things.
.
Revision 1.229  1999/09/25 02:01:26  root (set)
* Fixed: A crash when a file failed to load [only seen in Linux]. Reported by
Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>.
* Fixed: If the file had less than 2 bytes it was reported as a read error
[only under Linux and when using glibc 2.1]. Reported by Steve Wagor
<stevew@uis.net>.

Revision 1.228  1999/09/25 01:00:13  set
* Fixed: various typos in the web page, thanks to Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>
.
Revision 1.227  1999/09/25 00:27:34  set
* Added: Now the editor pass to external screen savers a file handle for a
file that contains the screen contents. It allows external screen savers
based on the current screen contents. Suggested by Gregorio.
.
Revision 1.226  1999/09/24 02:55:09  set
* Fixed: The Info and Help buttons of the Screen Savers setup window were
ever enabled and generated SIGSEGVs if used for internal screen savers.
Reported by Gregorio. Also by Ilker Aksen <Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
.
Revision 1.225  1999/09/24 00:20:33  set
* Modified name to ForceUpdate because that's better and was the name I used
in the list.

Revision 1.224  1999/09/24 00:17:27  set
* Added: New sLisp command: ForceRedraw asked by Endlisnis.
.
Revision 1.223  1999/09/21 00:39:43  set
* Fixed: When Alt+F2 didn't find any function it said No instead of Ok in the
dialog. Reported by Jeremy.
* Added: sLisp constants for WhichEditor to avoid "magic numbers",
documented.
* Added: GetSyntaxAtCursor sLisp command to know if the cursor is inside a
comment, a preprocessor line or a string. Suggested by Endlisnis.
.
Revision 1.222  1999/09/19 20:53:44  set
* Added: Full list of Spanish messages. Also fixed some menu and dialog
messages while testing the Spanish messages (cosmetic stuff).
.
Revision 1.221  1999/09/19 14:33:28  set
* Modified: Now the InfView desktop file is called infview.dkt.
* Fixed: InfView wasn't inserting the new infview windows as tileable so Tile
didn't work. (Both also for the LDD).
.
Revision 1.220  1999/09/19 14:23:12  set
* Fixed: InfView didn't paint the first match in a search across a file that
forced a node switch, other matchs in the same node were painted.
* Fixed: InfView left the match selection on after a node switch and was
visible until the cursor was moved.
* Fixed: InfView v0.2.4 said v0.2.5.
* Fixed: InfView command line example said `info' instead of `infview'
(imagine why ;-))
* Fixed: InfView was giving the same priority to partial matchs and perfect
matchs when the partial appears first. (in search best match member).
* Fixed: The cmcForceMatchPairHL command was recorded when recording macros
from keyboard so the length of the macro was enlarged without gaining any
functionallity, now is filtered.
<< All these bugs were detected by me while preparing a conference for the
<< Linux Demo Day here in Buenos Aires ;-)
.
Revision 1.219  1999/09/17 03:43:42  root (set)
* Added: Support for FHS in the configure script and the Linux compress
script.
* Fixed: Some details in the configure mechanism for Linux.

Revision 1.218  1999/09/16 02:25:38  set
* Added: Now the file dialog stores the path in the history even if you
abort. It also remmembers the last mask used. Suggested by Pavlos.
.
Revision 1.217  1999/09/15 23:50:51  set
* Fixed: The calendar object was pretending to be an ASCII table so when its
window was closed it didn't remove yourself from the list making Alt+0 to
crash. Reported by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au> and "Pavlos"
<gtoub@otenet.gr>.
.
Revision 1.216  1999/09/15 23:18:18  set
* Documented new commands and linked to the contex sensitive help.
* Fixed: The editor was trying a partial match for a reserved word before to
check for a full match with a user reserved word. It could be experimented
only with the Texinfo shl; I noticed it while updating the docs.
.
Revision 1.215  1999/09/15 22:50:30  set
* Added: cmcPushCursorPos and cmcPopCursorPos. They use a 12 levels (11
usable) circular stack (to avoid memory leaks). Added to the Edit menu.
* Added: cmcToggleCharCase "This is vi's '~' command -- it toggles the
case of the char under the cursor". Added to menu, also added block to
upper/lower. Both additions were suggested by Thiago F.G. Albuquerque
<thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.
.
Revision 1.214  1999/09/12 19:43:01  set
* Added: A lot of stuff for the configure mechanism, now it have the minimal
functionallity needed and works OK. I also added comments to the README,
added checks for consistency between the version.txt file and headers, fixed
various problems with the libamp compilation, etc.
.
Revision 1.213  1999/09/12 00:18:22  set
* Fixed: [Linux] the editor didn't read the right keybind.dat file. So
defining/undefining keys under Linux was quite hard. The file is created as
.keybind.dat and the editor was looking for keybind.dat. I don't remmember
when this problem was introduced.
* Fixed: Preprocessor lines that included a comment were drawn with an ASCII
0 at the end of the line. That's usually invisible, but not when using
ISO-LAT1U fonts (mainly Linux).
.
Revision 1.212  1999/09/12 00:09:35  set
* Fixed: A couple of bugs in the "delete file from disk" feature of the
windows list: a) Using a freed pointer and b) Asking for save a file that
will be erased anyways.
.
Revision 1.211  1999/09/08 00:13:22  root (set)
* Added: A check to see if the current directory is valid. Using bash you can
easilly delete the current directory and be "in the land of nowhere". If you
run the editor from such a place it gets really confused and does really
stupid things so is better to just abort and ask the user to be serious.

Revision 1.210  1999/09/07 23:54:30  root (set)
* Fixed: Save files as DOS (under Linux) could fail. It was mostly related to
the previous bug, but I added some code to make it independient.

Revision 1.209  1999/09/07 23:44:18  root (set)
* Fixed: Linux version wasn't converting DOS files to UNIX format. The result
was mixed style files! Don't know why I never saw this error.

Revision 1.208  1999/09/07 23:00:27  set
* Fixed: Now ^C and ^/ are disabled in Linux.
.
Revision 1.207  1999/09/04 20:53:44  set
* Added: Now the pseudo macros can be selected from the menu. It helps
people to learn what pmacros are available. To allow it now each pmacros have
a descriptive name. This addition is to allow more powerful pmacros in the
future. Documented.
* Added: Documentation for the Export as HTML feature.
* Added: An option to export the text as HTML but without using colors.
.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.35 12th public release.

Revision 1.206  1999/09/03 23:34:41  set
* Changed version to 0.4.35 to make a release.

Revision 1.205  1999/09/03 01:06:26  set
* Added: PMacros for HTML, they are very simple but could save some typing.
.
Revision 1.204  1999/09/03 00:24:48  root (set)
* Fixed: Problems when using more than 128 columns. Now the limit is 255x255.
* Fixed: Redraw needed when loading a desktop that was used with a big
resolution in one smaller [under Linux]. Is funny to see how the editor
reacts if you change from 80x25 to 132x60 using SVGATextMode in other console
while the editor is running.
.
Revision 1.203  1999/09/02 00:17:50  set
* Added: Now the amount of closed windows remmembered in the Alt+0 list is
configurable from Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General. Suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.

Revision 1.202  1999/09/01 23:48:24  set
* Modified: Now sLisp commands (and ...) and (or ...) are logical operators.
* Added: New sLisp operators (& ...) and (| ...) bitwise counterparts.
Suggested by Endlisnis.
* Fixed: Windows that had a "remmembered" mode with column cursor on produced
SIGSEGVs because of some unitialized variable.
.
Revision 1.201  1999/09/01 02:14:24  set
* Fixed: The editor was asking for save when switching to other window and
the current was modified.
* Added: Export as HTML option. Suggested by Pavlos.
.
Revision 1.200  1999/08/30 22:26:17  set
* Fixed: I forgot to include the extrscsv.txt file in the 0.4.34 distribution
so external screen savers aren't accessable from the menu :-(. So only some
users will be able to try'em.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.34 11th public release. Released as beta because of problems.

Revision 1.199  1999/08/29 18:34:49  root (set)

entered. Reported by Pavlos.
.
Revision 1.196  1999/08/26 01:57:20  set
* Cosmetic change in install.cc to avoid Allegro's color depths and joystick
drivers to be included (I already ensure it in another way). Suggested by
Pavlos.
* Fixed: An outdated command in the mp3 playing files about Allegro's low
quality sound. Pointed out by Pavlos.
.
Revision 1.195  1999/08/26 01:39:31  set
* Fixed: A bug in the MP3 player PAUSE. Reported by Pavlos <gtoub@otenet.gr>
.
Revision 1.194  1999/08/25 02:52:45  root (set)
* Added: The man page to the Linux package and installation process.

Revision 1.193  1999/08/25 01:18:44  root (set)
* Modified: The sleep time when idle under Linux. I reduced it to just 10
microseconds because if I let 1 ms the keyboard repeat rate becomes erratic.
Don't know exactly what's wrong. Doing it the editor doesn't eat CPU and works
ok.
.
Revision 1.192  1999/08/25 00:04:43  set
* Fixed: Now the sLisp ComplChoose doesn't wait for keystrokes if no
expression is provided or just one is provided. Pointed out by Endlisnis.
* Documented: The existence and use of the sLisp command "if". I exist since
the starting days but never was documented.
* Added: New sLisp commands: and or not
.
Revision 1.191  1999/08/22 23:25:31  set
* Upgrade to PCRE 2.07.
* Fixed: various warnings from gcc 2.96.
* Fixed: Transparent blocks bug that was experimented when using white as
selection color. I saw it while Agata was using the editor ... this girl will
blow my brains in one or another way.
.
Revision 1.190  1999/08/22 21:03:24  set
* Added: Some FAQs to the DOS FAQs file about the mouse.
.
Revision 1.189  1999/08/22 20:44:28  set
* Modified: Some small details in the readme files to make them easier for
Linux people. Looks like some of them are too much structured and fails to
find things if they have a small difference. Suggested by Taura
<learfox@deltanet.com>.
.
Revision 1.188  1999/08/22 20:29:04  set
* Fixed: Problems when pressing ^/ under W9x. This key triggers SIGQUIT in
djgpp's library but for some reason this mechanism fails and finally makes
W9x get upset. Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
.
Revision 1.187  1999/08/22 20:01:08  set
* Modified: Now sLisp strings supports escape sequences similar to the ones
used for C. There are a small difference: /n is expanded as /r/n for DOS and
to get just /n you must use /l (stands for Line feed). Previous behavior was
expand the escape sequences only when inserting text to an editor buffer. I
did it to fix some problems in an example provided by Endlisnis.
.
Revision 1.186  1999/08/21 02:32:33  set
* New!: Man page viewer incorporated to the editor.
* Fixed: One keywords line in the PICs shl.
* Modified: Easydiag input line to accomodate to the new feature in TV that
fixed the need of an extra character for small input lines.
* Fixed: The "resume" information for project and closed windows now changed
the version because in 0.4.31 the layout of the flags changed. *NHP*
* Added all the man page files to the source distribution.
* Added: A command line option to use the low level VGA routines to
save/restore the video modes. It seems to help for some buggy Matrox drivers.
* Fixed: Streamable constructors of TDskWin classes didn't initialize the
CanBeDeletedFromDisk flag. *NHP*.
* Added: Warning in the snap shot html page about the need of getting the
last version available of TV to compile the editor (snap shot version).

Revision 1.185  1999/08/13 01:16:36  set
* Added: Optional flag to sLisp's RunProgram to restore the screen after
running the program.
* Added: New sLisp command called strxlt to replace characters in strings.
Both to solve inconvenients running some DOS programs like mpasm (Grzegorz
pointed out the problems).
* Fixed: Problems when loading desktop files that makes references to syntax
highlight modes not found in the syntahl.shl file.

Revision 1.184  1999/08/12 23:23:04  set
* Added: Some extra checks to the flush undo info (used by expand/compact
tabs options) it could be the reason of some misterious crashes that Grzegorz
reported.
.
Revision 1.183  1999/08/07 22:11:51  set
* Fixed: The editor was creating read-only desktop files so they weren't
easy to update ;-). That's the default for open (I used it for a test).
.
Revision 1.182  1999/08/07 21:27:51  set
* Updated the license of Robert Hoehne.
.
Revision 1.181  1999/08/07 19:49:18  set
* Added: man pages for the editor and infview.
.
Revision 1.180  1999/08/07 15:09:03  set
* Added: External screen savers. Now you can write your own screen saver and
plug it in the editor. Requested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com>.
* Modified: Now the screen savers configuration have your own dialog because
now there are more things to configure. Documented. Linked with the help.
* Added: Four plasma screen savers (external ones). The sources are also
available (uses my plasma library). Added as optional in the DOS installer.
* Added: MakeHzGroup to easydiag.
* Added: Command line options for the external screen saver is stored in the
desktop file so the version changed: v0.4.34.
* Changed: the default sorting for File Open dialog.
.
Revision 1.179  1999/08/03 02:56:10  set
* Added: Now the sorting criteria of the files and directories in the
FileOpen dialogs can be customized. I added it to TV and now I added the
needed dialogs to the editor, the options are stored in the desktop file,
there are help available and the editor also gives some advices about the use
of SHIFT key. I did it as a result of a thread in djgpp list started by
Thiago <thiagofga@ambr.com.br>, supported by Clemens Valens
<c.valens@mindless.com> and discussed by Rolf Campbell
<cp1v45@nortelnetworks.com> and Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.
.
Revision 1.178  1999/08/01 21:01:45  root (set)
* Fixed: The screen saver weren't working under Linux. Reported by Grzegorz.
* Modified: Now the text mode screen savers are adjusted to the size of the
screen. Suggested by Grzegorz.

Revision 1.177  1999/08/01 19:43:55  set
* Fixed: In the overwrite warning the editor was checking if the user
answered No, but then if the user pressed ESC the action was performed, which
is really no intuitive.
.
Revision 1.176  1999/08/01 19:33:46  set
* Added: new sLisp command getenv, is just like the C version but also gives
access to the internal environment variables. Documented. Suggested by Thiago
<thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.
* Added: examples of getenv and the completion chooser to the examples.slp
file.
* Added: comments about x:/dev under DOS to the FAQ.
.
Revision 1.175  1999/08/01 17:56:49  set
* Added: ASCII Chart and Calendar windows. First suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>, second just because I don't know in what day I live
;-)). The code comes from the Robert's port of TVDemo with some small
changes.
* Modified: The mechanism to remove windows from the Alt+0 list. I added a
new broadcast to the library sent any time a window is closed. So now the
main application class of SETEdit receives this broadcast and removes the
window from the list. I hope I didn't break anything, the mechanism is really
complex, even when it simplified things a lot.
.
Revision 1.174  1999/08/01 13:38:18  set
* Added: Now you can set the editor to tile windows first vertically (instead
of horizontally). Is in the general options. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam
Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com>. New version forced by stored value v0.4.33.
* Added: Warning about running windowed in Diamond Stealth 2000 Turbo boards.
Diamond drivers are really buggy, specially stealth ones, I have a couple at
work and they are really buggy.

Revision 1.173  1999/07/27 02:04:54  root (set)
* Added: (strstr target_string search_string [start_offset]) -> position or
-1 sLisp command. Suggested by Endlisnis.
* Fixed: [Linux] Now when the editor is started with a resolution different
than the last used the windows are resized to fit in the new desktop size.
Reported by Grzegorz.

Revision 1.172  1999/07/26 23:43:53  set
* Added: A couple of Q/A to the linux faq from problems experimented by
Grzegorz.
.
Revision 1.171  1999/07/26 23:18:20  set
* Added: Now is possible to delete a file from the Alt+0 list for good, I
mean really unlink it in the filesystem (delete, erase, kill, etc.). That's
pressing Ctrl+Del and of course previous user confirmation that (of course
again ;-) can be disabled. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz
<gradha@iname.com>.
.
Revision 1.170  1999/07/25 17:04:22  set
* Fixed: In jump to function, if the word under cursor was "greater" than the
last function name (alphabetically) the dialog selected an invalid item.
Reported by John Scott Kjellman <jkjellman@ameritech.net>.
.
Revision 1.169  1999/07/25 16:03:33  set
* Fixed: SaveAs was setting the title of new files even if the save failed.
Reported by Jeremy.
.
Revision 1.168  1999/07/25 15:48:09  set
* Fixed: A typo in the Tip number 17. Reported by Enlisnis.
.
Revision 1.167  1999/07/25 15:09:00  set
* Added: Now the right button of the mouse pop-ups a menu. The menu is fully
customizable from the menubind.smn file. By default it contains: syntax help,
jump to function, find, replace, copy, paste and cut. I had it in mind for a
long time and a suggestion from Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au> made me
incorporate it.

Revision 1.166  1999/07/25 00:28:43  set
* Added: New sLisp command: ComplChoose, it pop-ups a list of options at the
cursor position. The pressed keys are used for incremental search, any valid
symbol for the current SHL select the focused item most of other keystrokes
rejects the selection returning an empty string. Is fully oriented to word
completion. Suggested by Endlisnis for Lemur.
.
Revision 1.165  1999/07/22 00:25:30  set
* Fixed: Opened files failed to inherit the "See Tabs" and "No inside tabs"
flags. Damn, I really forgot them in all the places. Reported by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Added: A new option to highlight the matching pairs on the fly. It is
called 500 ms after you stop typing to avoid slow downs because an excess of
computations that aren't really needed. Suggested by Ivan.
The setting is stored in the desktop files so the version is 0.4.32 now.

Revision 1.164  1999/07/21 01:11:46  set
* Fixed: The Tool&Ops|Options|Default global edition dialogs asked if the
user wanted to lose the changes with the reverse logic (when the user tried
to not lose ;-))
* Fixed: New file doesn't have syntax hl, but didn't inherit the default
options for files without syntax hl.
* Added: Now the snap-shot script generates valid files for DOS and UNIX no
matters what OS is used to generate the files.

Revision 1.163  1999/07/18 23:20:41  set
* Added: a Perl script to generate diffs between the current WIP and any CVS
tag. This will allow me to upload diffs and snap-shots.
.
Revision 1.162  1999/07/17 22:26:11  root (set)
* Added needed scripts and modified small details to create and package
InfView for Linux.
.
Revision 1.161  1999/07/17 21:41:05  set
* New!: A new standalone program can be created from the sources, is called
infview and is just an standalone info viewer. It have a command line very
similar to the FSF's info program. Many users asked for it.
.
Revision 1.160  1999/07/17 01:11:05  set
* Added: Search only in/outside comments options to the Find and Replace
dialogs. It forced to rearrange the editorFlags so the version changed
(v0.4.31). Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
.
Revision 1.159  1999/07/16 22:53:37  set
* Fixed: Cursor moved outside the screen when using non-persistent blocks and
replacing a selection by a typed character. Reported by Endlisnis.
.
Revision 1.158  1999/07/16 01:45:16  set
* Added: Now is possible to delete entries in the message box. I also added
the possibility to save the messages to a text file or copy to the clipboard.
All started with some suggestions from SpaZe.
.
Revision 1.157  1999/07/15 03:07:24  set
* Fixed: Now the editor commands are disabled during initialization, not only
when an editor loses the focus. In this way if you start with a clean desktop
the commands are disabled.

Revision 1.156  1999/07/15 03:05:01  set
* Added: The screen saver is activated if you left the mouse in the upper
right corner for a configurable period of time. Suggested by Spaze.
Also added to the general configuration and desktop file => v0.4.30.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.29 10th public release. Scheduled uploads to DJ's server, my three
sites, mails to Ivan and DanX, etc.

Revision 1.155  1999/07/14 23:31:16  set
* Fixed: 3 warnings from gcc 2.96.
* Fixed: I forgot dstfile.cc in the distribution.
* Fixed: If no dflopts.txt existed the flags to set the SHL were 0 (all local
options disabled!).
* Fixed: The OK button was grayed when editing the default options. Also added
a confirm before discarding potential changes.
* Fixed: multiline strings wrongly propagated if the contained an empty line
in the middle (only Linux).
* Note: all of this just before releasing, it delayed the release.
.
Revision 1.154  1999/07/13 22:48:45  set
* Fixed: BASIC shl needed AllowedInsideNames=$. Patch by Endlisnis
<s257m@unb.ca>
.
Revision 1.153  1999/07/13 02:12:29  set
* Fixed: Problems to redirect the output of childs when TMPDIR (or equivalent
variable) was defined as something like "x:/". That's because djgpp tools
gets upset if you use a file name like it: "c://file" (even when c://file is
valid both in djgpp and Linux). Is a very bad idea to define the variable
like this because other programs also have problems, I saw it in CVS while
comminting the changes.
* Note: Robert should do the same in RHIDE, in fact debugging it was slooowww
because RHIDE was failing to create some temporals and for some reason mktemp
becomes ultra-slow in this case.

Revision 1.152  1999/07/13 00:46:17  root (set)
* Added: Eterm theme, terminal description and full explanation.
* Added: Some hints about it in the readme.src and readme.1st.
* Added: All the changes and additions to the readme.1st.

Revision 1.151  1999/07/12 00:04:37  set
* New! "Default global edition" menu option. It was something I needed for
months and didn't have time to add. It's a complement for the "Global
Options" but sensitive to the syntax highlight for the current file. When the
editor selects the shl also enables/disables some local options related to
this shl. All of this is stored in an easy-to-edit text file, but also you
can edit it with nice dialogs ;-). Is documented and pressing F1 explains
how it works.
.
Revision 1.150  1999/07/11 14:16:08  set
* New! now you can define your own reserved words (user words) using dialogs
or just editing a text file.
* Added: Documentation, F1 hook and tip for the user words.
* Modified: Some important internal structures were modified. The main
important change is that I no longer use a SOSStack for the syntax highlight
strings, now all are separated strings. So the call to
LoadSyntaxHighLightFile changed a little bit.
* Note: This is all very new and not very well tested, don't spect 100%
reliable behavior and report any strange thing.
.
Revision 1.149  1999/07/09 19:31:27  set
* Fixed: The documentation of RunProgram* to say @var{program_name} instead
of @var{program name} to avoid confusion. Reported by Endlisnis.
* Added: Now (+ "Hello" 1) sLisp code returns "Hello1". Endlisnis reported
a problem in one of the examples and instead of limiting the example I
extended the language ;-)
* Fixed: Now when asigning a macro to a key the editor doesn't draw the
intermediate steps, it avoid cleaning the status line. Reported by Endlisnis.
* Fixed: The RunProgramRedir was returning a non ASCIIZ string. Reported by
Endlisnis.
* Fixed: The name of the sLisp command WhichEditor (was WichEditor).
* Added: A new optional parameter to sLisp command WordUnderCursor. (see docs)
* Added: A new editor's command: cmcGoEndOfWord. (see docs).
* Note: These modifications are to give better support to the Lemur v0.1a
prototype completion macro+program created by Endlisnis.
.
Revision 1.148  1999/07/09 15:22:29  set
* Fixed: G was used twice as short-cut in the Find Dialog. Reported by
Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Added: short-cut for the "RegEx Ops" button (O).
.
Revision 1.147  1999/07/07 23:59:42  set
* Added: Help for the "Open Read-only copy" option (documentation and F1).
.
Revision 1.146  1999/07/07 23:50:48  set
* Added: An option to open a read only copy of the current file we are
editing from disk.
* Fixed: Disabled some commands when no editor is selected: Print, RO copy,
etc.
* Fixed: Now the editor windows disables all the commands when they are
unselected. You'll get a lot of gray options if you select a non-editor now.
* Fixed: Now InfView windows enables/disables your commands.
* Note: I changed some internal stuff: (a) Added a new member to TCommandSet
class to enable/disable groups of commands (b) Added a parameter to
updateCommands, it says if the update is a full one or the class needs to
update just some commands and (c) the rectangular selection commands are
enabled/disableb only after one command related to it is processed, not all
the time.

Revision 1.145  1999/07/04 15:44:40  set
* Added: A progress bar when loading a file greater than 1Mb. The bar is
displayed during the parse process (much slower than the load). I tested it
with the disassebled code of the editor (15Mb ;-).
.
Revision 1.144  1999/07/04 15:21:29  set
* Added: A command to paste de Emacs mode associated with the current syntax
highlight and the tabsize as a comment at the start of the file. Documented.
Suggested by Ivan.

Revision 1.143  1999/07/04 13:58:01  set
* Added: Added EmacsModes and ShellScript shl commands. Looks like people was
confused about the fact that Files was used for the three so now they are
separated commands.
.
Revision 1.142  1999/07/03 19:16:19  set
* Added: A blanker to the screen savers. Suggested by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
* Fixed: Now the mouse is hided when the screen saver is on. Reported by
SpaZe.
* Added: A test button to make a preview of the screen savers. Suggested by
SpaZe.
* Fixed: The name of the "global editor options", now is "general editor
options" Reported by SpaZe.
* Added: F3 label in the File|Open menu. Suggested by SpaZe.
* Added: Now InfView copies all the #include directives with Alt+I, not just
the first. Suggested by SpaZe.
.
Revision 1.141  1999/07/03 17:06:51  set
* Fixed: When redirecting the output of external files if the last line
emitted by the external program didn't have /n it was discarded. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
.
-- Sent the change.log to the editor's mailing list (recently created) --
Revision 1.140  1999/07/02 02:39:37  set
* Fixed: Now project items are stored as relative names, not absolute. So you
can move projects from one disk to another.
* Fixed: The example.zip (for SDG) used absoulte paths so was hard to use.
* Added: A warning when adding files that can't be expresed as relative in
the project.
* Fixed: The command to go to the end of file didn't compute tabs so if the
last line in the file had tabs the position wasn't the EOL. Reported by
SpaZe / ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
* Fixed: When unindenting a block and the cursor was in the previous line of
the first line of the block the editor included it in the selection.
* Added: Pseudo-macros for Clipper.
* Added: A simple mechanism for "Advice" dialogs (they explain something to
the user and gives the option to not be displayed in the future). So they
will start to appear in many places. I think they are very good to learn. I
really liked it when I tried the VMware beta.
.
Revision 1.139  1999/06/30 02:39:34  set
* Added: Documentation for the #! stuff in shl files and warnings about the
fact that the editor remmember the shl of files.
* Added: @comment as secondary comment for Texinfo files.
.
Revision 1.138  1999/06/30 02:16:04  set
* Added: --no-compress option to the compress scripts. It avoids the call to
upx even when upx is installed in the system. Suggested by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.137  1999/06/30 02:08:13  set
* Added: A new command cmeDeleteBkps to delete all the backup files memorized
by the editor so you don't need to exit with quit to do it. That's very
useful when used in combination with "Remmember bkps to delete". I put it in
the Tool&Ops menu.
* Added: Documentation for it and some entries in the concept index related to
backups.

Revision 1.136  1999/06/30 00:52:00  set
* Fixed: If a comment works only when in first column and is found in other
place the editor now pass it for the other checks (symbol, etc.).
* Modified: Small enhancements to the batch files hl. Now more things are
symbol.
.
Revision 1.135  1999/06/30 00:34:49  set
* Added: New syntax hl. option: "RelaxNumbersCheck", when enabled words that
start with a number aren't indicated as wrong. That's useful for batch files.
* Fixed: The '.' can be used inside names in assembler files.
.
Revision 1.134  1999/06/30 00:10:42  set
* Added: "Remmember bkps to delete" option. Useful for users of Alt+Q. It
helps to keep delete the backup files which are useful but annoying.
As that's stored in the desktop file that's a new version: v0.4.29.
.
Revision 1.133  1999/06/29 02:26:26  set
* Added: Syntax highlight for PICs assembler (16C7x syntax) contributed by
Diego Brengi <brengi@inti.gov.ar>.
* Modified: My idea to save a directory read for the open dialog failed for
save as where the setData doesn't pass a wildcard, so now in this case I read
the directory first *NHP*
* Added: More checks in the installer for NT.
.
Revision 1.132  1999/06/27 20:17:13  set
* Updated the documentation for Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General, it was
outdated. Added information for five undocumented options.
.
Revision 1.131  1999/06/27 20:07:13  set
* Added: An option to the editor's general options. It works this way: when
enabled and if the user specifies at least one file name in the command line
all the windows already opened are closed. In this way only the files
specified in the commnad line are opened. Suggested by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.130  1999/06/27 19:37:58  set
* Modified: Now is possible to save the current file as UNIX/DOS. That's only
possible for this special case, not saving as other opened file.
Suggested by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au>.
.
Revision 1.129  1999/06/27 18:58:23  set
* Added: Documentation for the rectangular upper/lower commands.
* Fixed: The same bug that affected the rectangle paste was in block upper/
lower.
* Modified: Now the message that a rectangle can't be pasted outside the text
is reported by editorDialog.
* Fixed: When pasting rectangles outside the text using the move operation
you could lose the original text, specially because the undo state was
broken. Now the editor checks before deleting the text and also does it
before starting to fill the undo structure. Reported by
SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
.
Revision 1.128  1999/06/27 17:52:30  set
* Added: cmcSelRectToUpper and cmcSelRectToLower, they convert a rectangular
selection to upper/lower case. They have a side effect: tabs inside and
crossing the boundaries of the selection are converted into spaces. That's
because I first cut the rectangle process the block and then paste it again.
Any other solution will need much more code and make it more complex.
Suggested by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
* Fixed: A very old bug while using undo for rectangular selection operations.
I don't know if anothers remains but it was clear: the paste wasn't
initializing the member that indicates how many operations are grouped.
Reported by Alex Lozano and recently by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
.
Revision 1.127  1999/06/27 16:04:21  set
* Moved all the code for loading/storing desktop files from editmain.cc to
a new file called dstfile.cc.
* Added: <noscript> and </noscript> to the html syntax hl. file. Suggested
by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.
.
Revision 1.126  1999/06/27 14:50:39  set
* Fixed: Now the "See Tabs" and "No inside tabs" options are stored in the
desktop file. As the desktop file changed that's: v0.4.28.
* Added: The "Wrap words" option can be set for all the windows from the
global options dialog. Suggested by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>
.
Revision 1.125  1999/06/26 00:54:35  set
* Fixed: A bug when putting the PATH command in the autoexec.bat when the
installer couldn't find the PATH definition. Reported by Ivan.
* Fixed: Now the installer is can detect more cases of the PATH definition.
Reported by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.124  1999/06/24 23:25:08  set
* Added: Now I'm forcing some redraws when "See tabs" is enabled and I kill
spaces at the end of a line. In this way the user can see how they disapear.
Suggested by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.123  1999/06/24 22:06:32  set
* Added: a "pocket calculator", that's a simple calculator. From TV.
.
Revision 1.122  1999/06/23 23:11:16  set
* Modified: The OK button in the dialog to select MP3 files now says "Select".
* Fixed: Now double clicking adds the file to the MP3 list. (Reported by Ivan)
* Added: New button to the file open dialogs, it brings the change dir dialog.
Added after some questions from Ivan.
* Fixed: An extra directory read when opening a File Dialog.
.
Revision 1.121  1999/06/22 22:34:35  set
* Added: SpecialSymbol and SpecialSymbolCont to the shl syntax. It allows to
define special symbols constructed by two symbols that combined have a
special meaning. That's very useful for $# in Perl and Bash scripts and @@
for Texinfo files.
* Added: PartialKeywords to the shl file. That's used when keywords can be
embedded in other words and still valid, like this @AA is a keyword and
@AAxxxx is @AA keyword plus some text. In this mode the keywords search is
considerably slower. I added it after some mail exchange with Burton Radons
<loth@pacificcoast.net>.
.
Revision 1.120  1999/06/18 01:12:06  set
* Modified: Now the editor uses 32 bits flags for the syntax highlight stuff.
It consumes more memory but allows me to add better shl.
* Added: String3 definition to the syntaxhl.shl files, that's propagated to
the rest of the lines.
* Modified: String2 is now propagated too, the old behavior is obtained with
a new command: ShortString.
* Fixed: This addition allowed me to fix an annoying problem in the Perl and
Bash syntax highlight. These script languages supports three types of strings
and the three are propagated across lines. Now it works OK.
**Warning** I was careful with the changes and tested that no part is cutting
the attributes to the old size (16 bits), but I can't be sure so this version
is actually qualified as less stable than 0.4.26.
.
Revision 1.119  1999/06/17 02:04:28  set
* Added: Syntax Highlight for Texinfo files. Contributed by Burton Radons
<loth@pacificcoast.net>.
* Fixed: if two shl keywords were different just in the caseness(?) only
the first defined was taked. Example: @aa @AA. I was using a no case
sensitive collection to colect the keywords. Reported by Burton.
* Modified (Fixed): Now the editor stores the name of the syntax highlight
instead of the number. Before it if you inserted a definition in the middle
of the shl file you surely created a mess. So desktop files changed and
hence the version: v0.4.27.
* Added: Explanation where you must specify the Case keyword in the shl file
in the docs. That's important and wasn't mentioned. Reported by Burton.
.
Revision 1.118  1999/06/16 01:35:29  root (set)
* Added: Now the editor can detect the syntax of a file looking for
#!path/name. This line must be the first in the file. Suggested by Ivan.
* Added: Detection for Perl scripts without .pl extension.
* Added: Some very primitive syntax highlight for shell scripts. At least
bash supports three strings and the editor just one so the support is weak.

Revision 1.117  1999/06/15 23:18:41  root (set)
* Added: ncurses, gpm and RegDOS credits in the copyrigh file.
* Fixed: A problem in the INSTALL.MAK that made it fail if the user already
had the "e" symlink (it was included in the release of v0.4.26, just forgot
to commit).

Revision 1.116  1999/06/15 23:11:30  set
* Fixed: The Global editor options was failing to disable the "See Tabs" and
"Don't move inside tabs" options (I did a cut/paste and forgot to fix it ;-).
Reported by Diego Brengi <brengi@inti.gov.ar> (If I can say it was a report)
* Fixed: Now the editor looks for ~/tcedit.dst and ~/.tcedit.dst, not only
the last.
.
Revision 1.115  1999/06/15 22:55:49  set
* Fixed: Not restoring the attributes after saving a file. I forgot it in:
Revision 1.94  1999/05/23 19:28:22. Reported by Dean Limbaugh
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us>.
.
Revision 1.114  1999/06/11 00:15:46  set
* Modified: Now if the installer didn't change the autoexec.bat won't suggest
rebooting ;-)
* Modified: Now the about box is coherent with the new slogan for the editor:
"A friendly text editor". I changed as a result of some suggestions from
Jose Lacal.
* Fixed and Added: a lot of details in the readme.1st file. When I release
the editor I install it in many places so I read it ;-)
* Added: information about cwsdpmi, pmodedj and libwin in the copyright file.
* Fixed: some out-dated information in the copyright file.
* Updated: some information in infview documentation, now the name isn't
uppercase.
* Fixed: typos in the windows/dos FAQ.
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.26 9th public release. Uploaded to DJ's server (Simtelnet) and my home
page.

Revision 1.113  1999/06/10 01:39:19  set
* Added: Forced LFN=y in installer or it will fail to update menu and desktop
files.
* Added: Now the code modifies the .pif files to setup the working directory.
It avoids the creation of tcedit.dst files in the desktop.

Revision 1.112  1999/06/08 23:53:01  set
* Modified: Now I use libwin for the installer, that's faster and not
affected by the WinCrap bug I faced before.
* Added: Some (small) instructions about the installer in the readme.src.
* Fixed: Some versions and CPU model in readme.src.
.
Revision 1.111  1999/06/08 03:03:33  set
* Added: Finally I added the installer to the CVS tree. Currently is v1.02
beta, but seems to work acceptable. I added a directory, the sources
(including a patched version of datfile.c from Allegro to save 60Kb in the
final distribution, around 140 in the .exe), changes in the makefiles, added
to the list of files, project and a Perl script to generate the installer.
.
Revision 1.110  1999/06/06 16:50:53  set
* Modified: The readme and announce files for the new release.
* Added: More information about Alt+Mouse in the Linux FAQ.
* Fixed: Copyright year in the docs, last update, version, new description
for the dir.info, the description isn't in small caps in the .info (pointed
out by Ivan), fixed a chapter name containing ' (TeX gets confused), generated
the documentation in .dvi, .ps and .html formats and more.
.
Revision 1.109  1999/06/05 23:24:14  set
* Fixed: 3 warnings reported by egcs 1.1.2 from potato (other snapshots
didn't report it, all related to objects without specified type defaulting
to int). Also added initialization to 2 variables that egcs reports (wrongly)
that can be used unitialized. Warnings provided by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.108  1999/06/05 22:50:21  root (set)
* Applied: Patches to the Debian package files from Ivan. Not tested because
I need the potato debhelpers.

Revision 1.107  1999/06/05 21:40:34  set
* Fixed: Typos in the tips file.
* Added: Simple menu, tips and desktop files in the distribution for people
that want to use the editor but doesn't know about all of these strange
options included.
* Added: EasyDiag features: Multiline support for TSStaticText and wrapping
column. They are used by the WIP installer.
* Changed: Version number because desktop files changed. (v0.4.26)
* Added: Support for tabs in the printing. Now tabs looks the same as in the
screen. Suggested by Richard Sanders <richard@stardate.bc.ca>.
* Changed: Prototype of the PrintSource routine to accept the tabs' size.
.
Revision 1.106  1999/05/29 03:01:21  root (set)
* Added: Now patchenv.pl also fixes the TV dependencies.

Revision 1.105  1999/05/29 01:35:11  root (set)
* Applied diffs for the Debian package files from Ivan.

Revision 1.104  1999/05/29 00:36:24  set
* Compiled with the NT additions in TV. Now the editor works in NT Server
4.0 in a machine I have access, don't know others.
* Fixed: A syntax highlight bug in the generic engine:
" molw/t0x00/t/t/t;Comment" in a .asm is an example.
.
Revision 1.103  1999/05/27 22:05:38  root (set)
* Added: The print configuration dialog is now an EasyDiag(tm) dialog and
allows to choose between writing to a file or thru a program using a pipe.
* Added: A couple of functions to EasyDiag that makes easy to transfer the
with of the widder object to the rest (Used in the print setup).

Revision 1.102  1999/05/27 00:41:13  root (set)
* Fixed: A nasty bug. When the editor retreives the settings of a closed file
(you open a file that was previously opened and closed, then the editor
uses the same position, settings, etc.) the closed object was released and
the openFile function was accessing an already released block. Of course the
effect was random and produced two possible things: a) The column cursor
magically appears enabled b) SIGSEGV because (a) with ridiculous values.
* Fixed: Memory leak in the new backup list when creating more than one
backup of the same file *NHP*

Revision 1.101  1999/05/26 00:31:36  set
* Modified: Now I include the "new" header instead of using hardcoded
definitions (editmain.cc). Patch by Robert.
.
Revision 1.100  1999/05/26 00:25:35  set
* Wow! revision 100
* Modified: Went back to -gstabs+, now -gstabs+3. Suggested by Robert (I
disabled it in the past to save memory while debugging).
.
Revision 1.99  1999/05/26 00:08:54  set
* Fixed: references to str[n]*icmp. Pointed out by Robert.
.
Revision 1.98  1999/05/24 00:35:08  root (set)
* Added: A warning when switching to the user screen for Linux, that's
because currently the user must press ENTER which is not very intuitive and
the user could think the editor hanged.
* Added: Support fot multiline TStatiText in EasyDiag.

Revision 1.97  1999/05/23 23:45:59  root (set)
* Added: More information in the profile editor option. It now gives more
interesting information. I also fixed a problem in the Linux version which
didn't meassured the time consumed by the OS which, in some cases, is very
important. As an example: the editor can do 18560 lines/sec using VCSA and
using all the CPU, but only 1318 using xterm where 80% of the time is spend
by the OS to draw the text. VCSAs are about 5 times faster than using a
ttypN locally and 14 times faster than xterm.

Revision 1.96  1999/05/23 21:33:35  set
* Added: Number of selected lines in the ^Q-L command.
.
Revision 1.95  1999/05/23 20:35:30  set
* Fixed: Now the editor will delete backups of files in other directories
different than the working one, for that the editor keeps a list of created
backups. It also helps to delete files with the new backup options (hidden and
UNIX style).
.
Revision 1.94  1999/05/23 19:28:22  set
* Added: Hidden backups option.
* Modified: Now when a backup is created the editor will use a rename if the
file isn't a symbolic link and a copy only if the file is s.l. That's faster,
specially for large files.
.
Revision 1.93  1999/05/23 18:35:01  set
* Added: my old memmove again, that's twice faster the djgpp's libc version
in my system.
.
Revision 1.92  1999/05/23 17:26:33  set
* Added: A .pif file for the editor. It have some settings I think are the
best for the editor.
.
Revision 1.91  1999/05/21 14:06:00  root (set)
* Fixed: IsADirectory for Linux *NHP*
* Fixed: Now librhutils won't crash if we couldn't create the temporal file
*NHP*

Revision 1.90  1999/05/21 03:42:35  set
* Added: UNIX style bakup file names (name~).
.
Revision 1.89  1999/05/21 02:42:34  set
* Fixed: Now ".files" are backed-up as ".files.bkp" and not as ".bkp".
.
Revision 1.88  1999/05/21 02:32:09  set
* Added: Save DOS files as DOS for UNIX.
* Added: Save desktop files as hidden files.
.
Revision 1.87  1999/05/21 00:09:52  root (set)
* Added: Some mouse information in linux.faq (gpm and xterm issues).

Revision 1.86  1999/05/20 02:14:30  root (set)
* Fixed: The resize attributes of the clock where wrong. I saw it when
resized an xterm from 80x24 to 95x33, the clock just disapear but left a
hole in your place.

Revision 1.85  1999/05/20 01:48:31  root (set)
* Fixed: Some strange bug in Linux when generating the documentation using
SDG, looks like I can't trust feof when fopening with "wt+". I don't
understand it very well, but it filled my disk at work ;-).

Revision 1.84  1999/05/19 23:02:01  set
* Added: Some QBasic keywords to the BASIC shl. Contributed by Endlisnis
<s257m@unb.ca>.
.
Revision 1.83  1999/05/19 22:57:06  set
* Fixed: Now the editor doesn't hang if you load a file with lines multiple
of 0x10000. The editor now refuses to load such a files. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
* Added: A message when the editor is interrupted with Ctrl+Alt+Break.
.
Revision 1.82  1999/05/16 22:27:36  root (set)
* Added: another .env file for Linux, it have more interesting settings
(dynamic executable, no debug information, no warnings, linking with
installed libPCRE and libZ, etc.). But I keep the other because is more
bulletproof.
* Modified: the linux.faq because now Alt+8 doesn't generate 8 if the window
8 isn't there.
* I did a lot of enhacements to the Linux screen, keyboard and mouse stuff.
For details consult the Turbo Vision change.log.

Revision 1.81  1999/05/13 00:41:52  root (set)
* Modified: As Linux lacks access(name,D_OK) (bad, bad) I added a function
called IsADirectory in pathtool. It checks: (1) name exists, (2) name is
type directory and (3) user have execute access (it means user can use this
directory).

Revision 1.80  1999/05/12 23:57:30  set
* Fixed: In the errors parser absolute paths starting with / where
missinterpreted.
.
Revision 1.79  1999/05/12 00:03:15  set
* Fixed: Removing a secondary InfView from the list of windows produced a
SIGSEGV or SIGILL because the same object was released twice.
* Fixed: When a secondary InfView was released it released the BookMark so:
a) The rest of the InfViewer lost it. Most probably what Brett Porter
<blp01@uow.edu.au> experimented and that I tried to avoid in revision 1.78.
b) At exit when the main InfViewer was destroyed the BookMark was destroyed
again producing a SIGSEGV.
.
Revision 1.78  1999/05/11 23:08:22  set
* Fixed: Looks like even when I taked all the precautions to avoid having an
unitialized BookMark in InfView there is some way to achieve it so I added
yet another check.
.
Revision 1.77  1999/05/11 22:49:51  set
* Added: Now people switching from djgpp v2.01 to v2.02 won't get "Can't open
libc.inf" for projects where the libc.inf file was opened. Basically now
InfView will try to find libc.info if libc.inf isn't there (same for any .inf
file). Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au> experimented such a problem.
.
Revision 1.76  1999/05/06 03:51:56  set
* Fixed: Now the clock reduces the size of the menuBar instead of just
overlapping it. It didn't have any sense before, but now I added some code
to the menuBar that enlarge the space between items if there are enough
space so reducing the menuBar size could change the situation, in fact does
it when using spanish menues.
.
Revision 1.75  1999/05/06 00:34:41  set
* Fixed: Some stuff in gettext library. When I added a free() call to the
library to avoid leaks reports I didn't realized that when LANGUAGE and
other environment variables aren't defined gettext uses static strings that
makes free crash under plain DOS (Not W9x).
.
Revision 1.74  1999/05/04 03:03:47  set
*> I added some stuff related to a macro Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca> was trying
to do I also implemented some stuff I discussed with MDaniel
<mdaniel@balug.org.ar> some time ago.
* Added: RunProgramRedir sLisp command, it runs an external program and
redirects stderr and stdout to a file, the file is then returned as a string
variable. That's ultra powerful (and dangerous ;-).
* Added: WordUnderCursor sLisp command, it returns the word under the cursor.
Useful for external help and things like that.
* Added: ShowInSatusLine sLisp command, it shows an string in the status
line. Useful to show results to the user.
*> Now from the internal side:
* Modified: The RunExternalProgram function to get some flags that controls
the redirection. I added it to the rhideint.cc file, but the functionallity
is not implemented in RHIDE.
* Added: RunExternalProgramGetFile to get the redirected file. I also added
a dummy to rhideint.cc so it won't break the compilation, but is a dummy.
.
Revision 1.73  1999/05/01 16:02:07  set
* Added: Quotation of <rogerh40@aa.net> in the windos.faq about problems with
VShield.
* Fixed: Short cut for "Regula expressions" was the same used for "Global" in
the "Replace" dialog. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
.
Revision 1.72  1999/05/01 14:39:24  set
* Fixed: When pressing end in a line that contained only tabs the editor was
positioning the cursor at the end of the tabs but the visible cursor was
positioned in the first column producing a confusing effect.
.
Revision 1.71  1999/05/01 01:01:32  set
* Added: Code to detect if SET_FILES point to an invalid point and in this
case try to guess the right value and if it fails inform it and stop.
* Fixed: Now if the syntax highlight file can't be loaded the editor doesn't
derreference a NULL pointer (SHLArray).
.
Revision 1.70  1999/05/01 00:00:26  set
* Fixed: Now if TMPDIR isn't defined or is wrongly defined the stderr/stdout
redirection doesn't fail so easilly. Now I try with %TEMP%, %TMP%, /tmp, c:/
or .
.
Revision 1.69  1999/04/30 23:06:38  set
* Added: Greek fonts. I'm in the middle of a big change in the code page
stuff that will take some weeks.
* Fixed: "Home" button when no tcedit.dst was loaded (it used uninitialized
data).
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.25 8th public release. Uploaded to DJ's server (Simtelnet), my home
page, BALUG home page, LUGAr, sent to Ivan, announced in Freshmeat and
Linuxberg.

Revision 1.68  1999/04/21 23:07:13  set
* Fixed: Was not possible to load files with []=+, or ; from the open dialog
even when LFNs where available. The problem was in TV. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
* Fixed: The check for files modified after running an external program was
wrong, I don't know why I was checking the creation time instead of the
modification time. It also affected the Save with same time. I discovered it
while processing some code pages with Perl scripts from inside the editor
(using the run external program feature).
.
Revision 1.67  1999/04/18 23:33:44  set
* Changed: Now I use PCRE v2.04 for the Perl Regular Expressions. I was using
v1.07 of feb 1998, the new one is dated feb 1999.
.
Revision 1.66  1999/04/18 22:14:55  root (set)
* Applied changes to the Debian files from Ivan.

Revision 1.65  1999/04/18 22:08:46  root (set)
* Changed: Now the Linux version is also compressed with UPX.

Revision 1.64  1999/04/18 21:57:29  root (set)
* Updated: The Linux installation script, now the text will tell the real
default prefix (is stuffed by the Perl script), the text of the VCSA.SH
script and the FAQ to reflect the current condition.
.
Revision 1.63  1999/04/18 21:50:16  set
* Fixed: Now if a syntax highlight indicates that the "escape" character is
also a symbol it isn't displayed in red. That's the case of Perl where the
\ can be used outside strings.
.
Revision 1.62  1999/04/18 21:40:40  set
* Changed: to UPX 0.70 and -9 compression. Tried --best but is too slow and
doesn't help the editor.
.
Revision 1.61  1999/04/18 21:32:16  set
* Added: A workaround for a bug in the Windows 95 clipboard handling. Looks
like the Windows 95 clipboard can't receive an arbitrary number of bytes for
the clipboard (int 0x2F service 0x1703), instead you must (a) enlarge the
number to be a multiple of 32 and (b) ensure the string is padded with 0s. If
you pass a 32*n bytes string without doing it you kill the application that
pastes the text. How said W95 is idiot? nah.... I found it after crashing
Pegasus various times.
.
Revision 1.60  1999/04/16 02:28:31  root (set)
* Updated the linux.faq it had hints about things that no longer apply.
* Added: a file called version.txt to hold the number of the last release.
* Updated the INSTALL.LINUX because it had wrong information about the
default prefix.
* Updated the readme.1st to reflect the last changes and explain some Linux
specific stuff.
* Added: -f to the rm calls in Makefile to avoid error in the clean target.
* Modified: the compress scripts to use the version.txt.
* Removed the ../mp3/libamp.mak <-> rhide.env dependency from the makefile.
* Fixed: some wrong wording abour the default prefix in the makes/readme.txt.
Reported by Ivan.
.
Revision 1.59  1999/04/13 01:09:25  set
* Added: Syntax highlight for Phyton. Contributed by David
<david.stegbauer@cz.opel.com>.
* Added: A micro FAQ to the DOS version.
.
Revision 1.58  1999/04/13 01:06:47  set
* This file is to add common question that applies only to windows and DOS.

Revision 1.57  1999/04/11 00:31:56  set
> The bugs and leaks will remmember this battle for years ;-))
  I was hunting memory problems (malloc/free, out-of bounds and leaks) with
YAMD by Nate Eldredge <nate@cartsys.com>. Was just to make sure the editor
was clean. I was working in it five days, as a result:
* Various destructors of TVision were modified to release the allocated
memory.
* I patched gettext library to release the allocated memory.
* Modified djgpp libc to release the atexit linked list. The patch was
incorporated to the 2.03 WIP.
* Heavilly modified YAMD 0.23 to ignore allocations from putenv, __alloc_file
and _invent_inode.
* Added code in many places to release the allocated memory at exit, some of
these places are: a destructor for TCommToMacroCol and TMLIBase, a new class
called TLispConstString to replace a static TLispString, hook in fstrcmp and
many UnLoad... calls to routines that releases memory.
  With these things I managed to get a 0 leaks report from YAMD and using it
I found:
* An out-of bounds read in the copy of the fonts data to the transfer buffer.
It could become dangerous in the future.
* A leak in the EasyDiag destructors.
* A leak in the calculator dialog (use of delete instead of destroy).
* A leak in the functions list when no functions were found or you exited
with ESC.
* Powered Grep didn't delete the passed "word under cursor".
* A potentially important leak in the undo of the TCEditor class. The editor
wasn't deleting it in the destructor.
* A leak in flushUndo (not killing the already used by undo cells).
* A leak in the rectangular blocks, propietary clipboard not deleted in the
destructor.
* A leak when clearing a rectangular selection.
* A leak when copying to the rectangular selection clipboard and using undo
plus redo.
* A leak in the "Screen Options" dialog (list of fonts not released).
* A leak in the project window (items not released when closing the project.
Use of delete and not destroy).
* Another leak when deleting items from the project.
* A leak in the "Tip of the day" dialog (destroy).
* A leak in the syntax help search (not releasing the word under cursor).
  Also and thanks to the heavy use of the memory when using YAMD I found:
* Fixed: Bug in insertBuffer failed when the buffer reallocation moved the
base of the buffer and then we tried to undo this action.
  In the middle time:
* Fixed: When a file had 0 bytes it was reported as read error.
* Fixed: When the editor failed to load a file it wasn't inserted in the
desktop but was inserted in the ALT+0 list producing a GPF/SIGSEGV when
asking for the list of windows. Reported by "Dean Limbaugh"
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us> (a Linux user).

Revision 1.56  1999/04/02 18:49:51  set
* Fixed: Character 0xD0 in "IBM PC 850" code page.
* Fixed: Character 0xD8 in "IBM PC 852" code page.
* Changed: Some names of the code pages to be more clear.
* Added: Full documentation for the layout of my fonts with Unicode
equivalence. I used tables that Fojtik Jaroslav <FOJTIK@vision.felk.cvut.cz>
sent me to do the job.
.
Revision 1.55  1999/04/02 15:16:00  root (set)
Many things related only to the Linux version:
* Now the executable is called setedit and the installer creates a symlink
called e. That's more similar to DOS where I use e.bat.
* Changed: Now the docs are compressed with -9. (Ivan).
* Changed: The installation is to /usr by default now. (Ivan).
* Added: Search for files in /usr and not only /usr/local tree. (Ivan).
* Fixed: The message about wrong installation now displays ok. (Ivan).
* Fixed: ALT+F5 now waits for ENTER.

Revision 1.54  1999/04/01 23:24:50  set
* Changed: Now Optimal Fill doesn't use a tab when only one space can be used.
.
Revision 1.53  1999/04/01 22:56:19  set
* Added: A new target to the makefile called clean-docs to remove all the
generated docs. Suggested by Ivan Baldo.
.
Revision 1.52  1999/04/01 22:46:26  set
* Added: A key to stop the DOS version, that's Right Shift+Control+Delete.
That's just a test, don't know if that's definitive.
.
Revision 1.51  1999/04/01 22:16:15  set
* Applied the -2 and -3 diffs for the Debian package files from Ivan.
.
Revision 1.50  1999/04/01 21:48:00  set
* Added: History to the "Goto line" dialog. Suggested by Fojtik Jaroslav
<FOJTIK@vision.felk.cvut.cz>.
.
Revision 1.49  1999/04/01 20:02:09  set
* Changed: The name of the editor's help. As the editor is officially called
setedit is sensible to call the help file setedit.info and the language file
setedit.mo (I changed it too). It was suggested by Ivan Baldo to avoid
potential problems with the Debian alternatives which could create a symlink
editor.info -> default_editor_name.info. It wasn't a simple change because
just changing it all the old users will get "Can't find 'editor' help" when
loading old desktop files. So I added an obscure feature: if the editor loads
an old desktop file and it makes reference to a editor.info that's changed
to setedit automagically. I know it could be bad, but will help in 99,99% of
the cases.
.
Revision 1.48  1999/04/01 18:56:36  set
* After fixing my monitor (was a problem in the PCB, very silly, hard to
find) I starting with the todo list of the day ;-) [the monitor was
manufactured in march of 1991 ... and then I must read posts in the list
about trashing three years old equipment ...] Added: a configuration variable
to the .env files to setup the directory for the support headers. In this
way you can use installed libraries instead of the provided ones. Requested
by Ivan Baldo for the Debian package.
.
Revision 1.47  1999/04/01 01:25:57  set
* Added: Now you can enter a VESA mode in the "Screen Options" to use
something like 132x60 (mode 0x10C). The fonts doesn't work (at least in my
board). I added it because Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com> asked about
it.

Revision 1.46  1999/04/01 00:06:03  set
* Fixed: Now if you save the undo behaves taking in count that the
"unmodified" copy is now the one on disk. Reported by Thiago F.G.
Albuquerque <thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.
.
Revision 1.45  1999/03/31 23:31:27  set
* Added the libset.mak and other two .mak files to the source distribution
because now Robert integrated the new version of the editor to RHIDE and
people that needs to compile RHIDE without having RHIDE needs this .mak.
.
Revision 1.44  1999/03/31 23:15:49  set
* Added: The "Set Global Options" is now available even if no editors are
opened. Is funny that I already designed all to support it (static class
members) but never implemented it until a couple of users pointed it as a
bug.
* Fixed: Now if no editor windows are opened the "Set Local Options" command
is disabled. This and previous were reported/suggested by: Robin Y. Millette
<millette@bigfoot.com> and Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
.
Revision 1.43  1999/03/31 22:47:44  set
* Added: a key mapping for cmcSmartUnIndent, I lost it when I did the new
keyboard handling. Additionally I fixed some wrong explanations about this
command found in the docs. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
.
Revision 1.42  1999/03/31 22:26:02  set
* Fixed: a problem with the manifest file, it contained distrib/ as prefix
for all the files and made impossible the uninstall making "rm @manifest/..."
Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.
.
Revision 1.41  1999/03/31 22:07:08  set
* Bug killed: GetDefaultScreenSaver() was returning a pointer to a static
string and then in the Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General I was deleting this
string. This bug was reported by different persons under different
situations: Joerg Jungermann <Joerg_Jungermann@accident.cpp.de>, Ivan Baldo
and Adam Schrotenboer <ajschrotenboer@lycosmail.com>.

Revision 1.40  1999/03/25 00:29:11  set
* Added the first Debian files from Ivan.
.
Revision 1.39  1999/03/23 00:45:10  set
* Changed: all the references to libtv.a to librhtv.a in the gprs because I
changed the name of the library.
* Changed: Now the rhide.env file defines TVISION_INC as the directory where
the Turbo Vision headers are located. That's needed for the Debian package.
Before I was defining TVISION pointing to the place where the sources are
located, but in Debian the sources doesn't need to be installed, just the
binary package.
.
Revision 1.38  1999/03/22 23:45:40  set
* Fixed: a bug that prevented the use of Linux desktop files under DOS. It
was very silly but is in all the older versions. The editor was saving a
random palette and when used in DOS the result was unpredictable (normally a
black palette). Now the Linux version saves the BIOS default palette.
.
Revision 1.37  1999/03/22 23:07:52  set
* Killed a bug in Tool&Ops|HTML Accents, I forgot to reload the base pointer
of the buffer and it can be changed while inserting text. I found this bug
while writing HTML pages about my vacations (the reason of no changes in
weeks ;-)
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.24 7th public release. Bug fix release.

Revision 1.36  1999/02/22 01:58:45  set
* Changed version number and updated readme.src.

Revision 1.35  1999/02/22 00:06:07  set
* Fixed a bug that made the editor crash while loading desktop files older
than v0.4.20. Introduced by the 1999/02/07 12:55:02 change. From reports of
Robin Y. Millette <millette@bigfoot.com>, Luis Pistoia <lu5gpl@arnet.com.ar>
and Martijn Versteegh <VERSTEEGH@KVI.nl>
* Enhanced the syntax highlight support for .BTM files. Additions by Robin
Y. Millette <millette@bigfoot.com>.
* Applied a patch by Andris to librhutil, just to be syncronized because this
function isn't used from this library.

Revision 1.34  1999/02/18 02:38:33  set
* Compiled with djgpp v2.02 and gcc 2.8.1. Removed the files needed to patch
djgpp 2.01.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.23 6th public release, sources and binaries uploaded to DJ's server,
announced in the djgpp mailing list, binaries and sources uploaded to my
home page and sources and binaries of the Linux version uploaded to my
home page. (edi0423s.zip is around 1Mb).

Revision 1.33  1999/02/16 22:04:41  set
* Changed make by $(MAKE), the first fails in DOS.
* Added "hurry" chapter to readme.src.
.
Revision 1.32  1999/02/15 23:09:07  set
* Added more information in readme.src, mostly details.
.
Revision 1.31  1999/02/15 22:54:19  set
* Added a #error stop point in the libamp sources to warn the user if is
trying to use Allegro 3.0.
* Added more instruction to compile the editor without MP3 support.
* Added a check in the DOS' compress.pl to see if the make of the docs
was successful.
.
Revision 1.30  1999/02/15 22:33:11  root (set)
* Fixed fromunix.pl and added a cp call to copy the djgppenv.env file as
rhide.env. Similar change in the fromdos.pl.
* Some clarifications in the readme.src (Perl needed for installation).
* Added an 'editor' target to the make file (make -f editor.mak), made it the
default target, made distrib and install depend on the 'editor' target.
* Added a -f to the rm calls in REMOVE_UNNEEDED to avoid a lot of messages
from rm, added deletion for /usr and /usr/local locations.
* Added a check for gzip, makeinfo and successfully docs creation in the
Linux's compress.pl. Added change.log.gz.
* Added quick instructions to compile the editor in the readme.txt.
* Updated the distribution readme.1st and announce (distrib1.txt and
distrib2.txt) to reflect the last changes.
* Fixed: a strong bug in the editor, it was possible to select text outside
the buffer if the last line didn't contain an end of line marker. Even when
it looks harmless if you tried to delete a block with this 'feature' the
editor generated a SIGSEGV.

*------- Tagged this point as ivan0423 and sent a copy to Ivan Baldo -------*

Revision 1.29  1999/02/15 00:20:45  set
* Modified: Now when the editor loads a default desktop file (not from the
current directory or a project) the default load, save, etc. points are
ignored. That's important for people that uses only one centralized desktop,
if I don't do it the editor will remmember the last point where s/he saved
the file and this is very confusing.
.
Revision 1.28  1999/02/14 23:52:34  set
* Added code to setup the tabs colors to a default for all desktop files
where the value is 0.
* Added a default for the tabs in the mochrome palette.
.
Revision 1.27  1999/02/14 23:06:46  root (set)
* Added the make install target to Linux.
* Added 'prefix' and 'install' parameters to the Linux compress.pl file.
* Changed: Now InfView by default searchs the info files in /usr/local/info
and then in /usr/info.
* Modified the INSTALL.MAK file to handle the 'prefix' much better.
* Changed: Now the usage is printed to the stderr.

Revision 1.26  1999/02/14 20:48:35  set
* Added 'prefix' facility to the DOS compress.pl, using --prefix PREFIX, or
the environment variables PREFIX and prefix.
* Added 'install' facility to the DOS compress.pl.
* Added install target to the makefile.
* Changed the contrib/setedit directory by contrib/setedit.bin in the binary
distribution.
* Updated the year in the about box.
* Added explanation about the new targets in the readme.txt.
.
Revision 1.25  1999/02/14 15:23:32  set
* Updated the copyright year (1999).
* Updated my telephone number, ugh! now is huge.
.
Revision 1.24  1999/02/14 14:11:38  set
* Added help for the new edition modes, the file open dialog and other things.
* Fixed some typos in the help and menues.
* Changed all the cmbXXXX references in the help by cmcXXXX.
* Added context sensitive help to more menu entries, fixed for others.
* Added context sensitive help to most of the dialogs.
* Enabled SDG (was accidentally disabled in the 0.4.22/23 snapshots).
.
Revision 1.23  1999/02/13 15:17:16  set
* Added an example of menu configuration called redmond.smn, WinCrap users
should like to try it. Triggered by a suggestion of Thomas Knudsen
<tk@gfy.ku.dk> to use Ctrl+Tab for next window.
* Fixed: a problem in my v2.01 libc copy (no in the original) that messed
some things when ^C was pressed. I don't know if it affected a public release
of the editor.

Revision 1.22  1999/02/12 22:52:45  set
* Incorporated the last version of librhutil from Robert and applied the
patches I did and forgot to tell Robert.
.
Revision 1.21  1999/02/12 22:28:19  set
* Changed SETFindFile to FindFiles again and did it available only when using
STANDALONE, in this way Robert can overwrite it with your own version.
.
Revision 1.20  1999/02/12 22:16:41  set
* Fixed: When using Alt+F5 (Show user screen) the editor was polling the
keyboard without calling idle() and hence eating CPU. Reported for RHIDE by
Gili <sl@psycode.com>.
.
Revision 1.19  1999/02/11 00:38:50  set
* Version 0.4.23 reported by the editor. I already released snapshots of the
editor with the number inside so is time to reflect it in about and in .dsts.
.
Revision 1.18  1999/02/11 00:32:08  set
* Fixed: Sometimes when opening a closed window the cursor position even when
restored OK was showed in the wrong position giving a surprise when typing.
* Hey! what a night I killed more bugs today than all the bugs killed in
december and january *;-)

Revision 1.17  1999/02/11 00:21:08  set
* Fixed: Tips of the day was using gmtime instead of localtime. It triggered
the tips at 9:00 pm in my case ;-)
* Fixed: The printing routines used gmtime instead of localtime. I fixed it
because I made a global search for gmtime ;-))
.
Revision 1.16  1999/02/11 00:14:35  set
* Added support for Windows clipboard in the InfView windows. Suggested by
Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>.
* Added a Makefile target called 'distrib' to call the distribution scripts.
.
Revision 1.15  1999/02/10 23:38:04  set
* Added: Now the command line is more POSIX compliant, well at least supports
short and long commands. I used the GPL'd getopts_long function in DOS
because djgpp lacks this functionallity.
.
Revision 1.14  1999/02/10 22:23:58  set
* Added: now when "Scroll lock centers" is on the searchs are centered too.
Suggested by SpaZe / ST <stealth.tech@usa.net>.
.
Revision 1.13  1999/02/10 01:06:25  set
* Fixed the "Compact text" option. Now it doesn't replaces tabs by spaces
when only one space will be replaced. Reported by Andy <andygoth@juno.com>.

Revision 1.12  1999/02/10 00:35:59  set
* Fixed a typo in the tips dialog. Reported by Stuart Hall
<Stuart.Hall@aetna.com>.

Revision 1.11  1999/02/10 00:15:58  set
* Added a command line switch to enable the Red Hat 5.2 keyboard mapping
style. Not tested yet (you can see it was under DOS). I found the keyboard
differences with the help of Tom Aschenbrenner <tom@aschen.com>.
* Fixed the parsing routines to support strings inside preprocessor lines. An
interesting thing is that a string opened inside a #define extends the
#define. I hope it will work ok. Bug reported by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@usa.net>.
.
Revision 1.10  1999/02/09 23:10:28  set
* Some fixes in the documentation:
 * Fixed some typos.
 * Added better information about pmacros, was outdated. Suggested by Stuart
 Hall <fprintf@iname.com>.
 * Renamed a chapter that have the same name as other and was hided
 (Miscellaneous).
 * Added better information about the current license (GPL).
* Added the copying.* and copyrigh files to the binary distribution.
.
Revision 1.9  1999/02/09 00:29:46  set
* Added a new mode to the editor called "Don't move inside tabs". When this
mode is on is very hard to put the cursor in the middle of a tab (I hope
quite impossible ;-). When you try to do it the cursor is automagically moved
to the start of the tab character so when you type you don't get surprises.
A lot of people asked about it, here is a small list: "a.meyer"
<hexx3000@schaltzentrale.mvnet.de>, MDaniel <mdaniel@balug.org.ar>, Sinan,
Andy M Goth <andygoth@juno.com>, etc. With this second addition tabs users
will get a big boost ;-)
.
Revision 1.8  1999/02/07 16:48:30  set
* Added code to support the new "Try" button in the Color Dialog that I added
to TVision (see the TV package for more information).
* Added a new mode to the editor called "See Tabs". It paints the tabs, even
when they are selected. Any similitude to the methode used in killtabs by
Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com> or the Midnight Commander editor is
only coincidence ;-)). Additionally: I hope MDaniel will stop complaining
about what hard is to locate tabs (the same for Andy <andygoth@juno.com>).
.
Revision 1.7  1999/02/07 12:55:02  set
* Minor fixes to make the code more RHIDE friendly: RSIndicator link request,
Expand...() only in standalone (RHIDE uses your own replacement) and renamed
FindFile to SETFindFile. All from suggestions of Robert after testing the
first snapshot of 0.4.23 with the new directory structure.
.
Revision 1.6  1999/01/31 15:37:21  set
* Included the LibAmp sources in the package to avoid distributing the
binaries.
* Linked with Allegro 3.1 and checked the 16 bits sound and additions to
avoid linking the whole library were incorporated by Shawn (all OK).

Revision 1.5  1999/01/29 01:41:44  root (set)
* Created the compress.pl Perl script to create the Linux distribution files.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/26 00:16:52  root (set)
* Various small adjusts to compile under Linux.
.
Revision 1.3  1999/01/25 23:08:07  set
* Modified the name files to use the new Uses_n request for the n() macro.
.
Revision 1.2  1999/01/19 23:47:24  set
* Passed the files to a CVS repository.
.

14.12.1997: Added: ESC now is mapped to un/hide the selection instead of
            an ASCII 27. (Suggested by Laszlo).
            
14.12.1997: Bug Killed: The grep interface showed a double slash for root
            directories. (Reported by Laszlo).
            
14.12.1997: Release v0.4.12 to the public (3rd).

27.12.1997: Fixed: Some russian and normal chars in 3 fonts. (Reported by
            Alexander Bokovoy,BY).
            
27.12.1997: Bug Killed: When running the editor by first time or with a .dst
            older than v0.3.0 the selected code page were -1 selecting ISO
            Latin 1. (Reported by Ed <Myknees@aol.com>).
            
27.12.1997: Bug Killed: A GPF if the open file failed. (Reported by Ilya,RU).

27.12.1997: Added: A warning when opening read-only files and a try to revert
            the flag.
            
27.12.1997: Bug Killed: Another bug in autoindent.

03.01.1998: Bug Killed: A huge bug in truename producing a rename of the
            directory instead of the back up file under W95. (Reported by
            Ilya,RU).
            
03.01.1998: Version 0.4.13 released to the public (4th).

18.01.1998: Added: SHL for NASM files (Ivan,IT).

18.01.1998: Added: A new command to the SHL language.

18.01.1998: Fixed: 0x SHL failed when Case=0.

21.01.1998: Bug Killed: When using a generic SHL in lines with many spaces
            at the end of the visible line the painting buffer overflowed
            generating a GPF.

27.01.1998: Bug Killed: Problems to change the read-only mode in plain DOS
            because the file was opened (it works in W95).

28.02.1998: Added: A warning in files with ASCII 0 (Suggested by Laszlo).

28.02.1998: Added: When searching and the match is at the right of the screen
            now all the word is showed and no just the first character.
            (Suggested by Ivan Baldo,UY).

28.02.1998: Version: 0.4.14. Sent to Robert and included in RHIDE 1.4.5 (?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

02.03.1998: Bug Killed: The .dst files weren't closed avoiding the deletion
            of these files by ALT+Q. (Only under W95).

03.03.1998: Added: After selecting a project item with an incremental search
            the search is restored to 0 length allowing another search.

18.03.1998: Fixed: A silly limitation of 99 columns in the wrap column
            setting (Reported by Brett Porter,AU).
            
18.03.1998: Added: Now the command to search the complementary pair
            (parentheses, etc.) is mapped to Ctrl+Q-ESC like in BC.
            (Wasn't asigned in v0.4.x).
            
18.03.1998: Added: Enabled Ctrl+Shift+9 and Ctrl+Shift+0 to match parentheses.
            But for this you'll need to load my TSR that expands the BIOS
            functionallity because BIOS doesn't report some keyboard
            combinations.

26.03.1998: Added: Help for the pull down menues. (25 and 26).

22.04.1998: Fixed: InfView failed to handle splitted .info files when the
            file weren't located in the INFOPATH directories.

06.05.1998: The following wasn't made in this day but in the last two weeks.

06.05.1998: Added: Tip of the day.

06.05.1998: Added: Dialogs with my easydiag library.

06.05.1998: Added: All in the window that asks for replace. (Suggested by a
            user).
            
06.05.1998: Fixed: Now to know if a file is read only I use stat and not
            fstat because it fails in DOS+NETX (Novell). (Reported by Alex).
            
06.05.1998: Fixed: Now instead of using _truename+_fixpath (see 14.12.1997)
            I use the device number and starting i-node to know if the file
            is already opened. The first methode fails under DOS+NETX
            (Novell). (Reported by Alex, Suggested by Eli,IL).
            
06.05.1998: Fixed: Now the readme.1st is loaded just once even is the user
            doesn't disable the mini-about dialog.
         
06.05.1998: Added: Now if the user doesn't define SET_FILES and/or INFOPATH
            the editor tries to guess and only complains if fails in the
            guess.

07.05.1998: Finished: Tips in the message window.

07.05.1998: Added: About window.

07.05.1998: Added: Now the editor warns if gzip or grep aren't installed
            and they are needed. Only under DOS.

08.05.1998: Added: Now the file open dialog memorize the points where the
            files are stored/loaded and have a Home button to go back to the
            point where the editor was loaded.
            
08.05.1998: Added: The search & replace options are stored in disk.
            (Suggested by Elias Pschernig <f.x.gruber-museum-arnsdorf@
            magnet.at>).

08.04.1998: Version 0.4.15.

13.05.1998: Added: New search & replace system, includes tags in the replace
            and Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions. (9-13). (Suggested by
            Laszlo).

13.05.1998: Version 0.4.16.

14.05.1998: Fixed: Compact text doesn't have undo so using undo produced
            problems. (Reported by Peter Palotas <blizzar@hem1.passagen.se>).

15.05.1998: Fixed: GKey: Num-Lock OFF, Shift+Gray Number is reported by BIOS
            like a number instead an arrow key. (Reported by Gili
            <sl@psycode.com>).
            
15.05.1998: Added: Mapped Shift+BackSpace to BackSpace by default. Mapped
            Shift+Enter to Enter. (Suggested by Peter Palotas
            <blizzar@hem1.passagen.se>).
            
15.05.1998: Fixed: Applied various small patchs from Robert mainly related to
            Linux.
         
15.05.1998: Fixed: A typo (ligth en lugar de light). (Reported by a Linux
            user).

17.05.1998: Ported to Linux. It was the first time I did it. Sent copies to
            Dim (RU) and Laszlo (HU) for testing.
            
17.05.1998: Fixed: A double call to free in the dskwin that handles InfView.
            It produced a SIGSEGV in Linux during the exit.

19.05.1998: Added: Now file open stores the path+mask in the history.

20.05.1998: Applied the patchs I did in Linux to the mainversion.

20.05.1998: Moved various dialogs to new files to allow Robert to use my
            dialogs.

22.05.1998: Updated this change.log file. (21-22).

22.05.1998: Added: When jumping to a function now the editor searchs the
            closest name to the word under cursor and selects it in the
            list (Suggested by Alex).

23.05.1998: Rearranged some directories for PCRE and ZLib.

23.05.1998: Added: Built-in support for gziped .info files (no more calls to
            gzip).

24.05.1998: Added: Insert & Delete shortcuts in the key binding dialogs.

24.05.1998: Added: Insert shortcut in the list of windows dialogs.

24.05.1998: Fixed: In the key bindings, when selecting a command, now the
            commands list have the focuse at start and not "Cancel".

24.05.1998: Added: MP3 songs player! I think the exe will explode ;-)

25.05.1998: Fixed some things in the MP3 stuff, patched Allegro to save 150Kb
            in the exe file. Patches sent to Shawn.

14.06.1998: Patched Allegro to mix the sound in 16 bits instead of 8 bits.
            Patches sent to Shawn. (13-14).

15.06.1998: Added a dialog to configur the Num-Lock behavior. Suggested by
            Eli.

16.06.1998: Replaced the libc __dpmi_yield by the new version provided by
            Eli.

17.06.1998: Fixed a bug in InfView. It was jumping to nodes of similar names
            in DOS files (fade_interpolate v.s. fade_in in Allegro 3.0 info).
            It was because both pass a test with strncmp(s1,s2,strlen(s2)).
            (Reported by Gili).

17.06.1998: Modified the Linux version to open the redirected stderr file in
            the home directory instead of the share. (Suggested by Laszlo).

17.06.1998: Various modifications in the paths used to load/store the
            configuration files under Linux. Mainly: now the user saves in
            your home hidden files and the editor looks first for these
            files and then in the share directory. Not tested.

18.07.1998: Added support for Emacs style syntax highlight selection. Added
            because a request of Gili <sl@psycode.com> about the fact that
            new C++ standards (dead brain ones) specify headers without
            extentions. For this reason now Boolean TCEditor::loadFile()
            takes a parameter, Boolean setSHL, when true the function sets
            the syntax highlight searching for -*- SHL name -*- in the first
            Kb and the last 3Kb of the file as Eli suggested (Emacs behavior),
            if that isn't found the extention is used. The only place where
            loadFile is called in this way is in the constructor. By default
            the parameter is False making the function call compatible with
            previous versions. The other place where the SHL is set
            automatically is in the SaveAs member. Additionally I added
            support for some strange files (from SGI and HP found in GNU C++
            libraries) that uses a "mode:C++" keyword. The editor uses the
            list of extentions as valid modes so I added "C++" as an
            extention (see syntaxhl.shl file).

18.07.1998: Added a new sLisp command to call external programs. The syntax
            is: (RunProgram "prg1;prg2;..."). It calls the program/s
            specified, captures the stderr and show the errors in the
            message window. With that the user can assign any program to
            any key. It was added because a comment of Tomas Kouba
            <kouba@fzu.cz> about the need of running different makefiles
            from the same project. To avoid conflicts with RHIDE the function
            that calls the external program is part of the editor and a dummy
            is provided in rhideint.cc. Robert: you should fill the body of
            this dummy with a call to a function that makes this work inside
            RHIDE. Note: The editor currently capture stderr AND stdout, so
            all is callected. As an example I did a vey simple macro that
            shows the contents of the current directory using "ls -la".

18.07.1998: Killed a bug in the "Match pair highligth" option. When typing
            three consecutive symbols one weren't correctly un-highligthed.

19.07.1998: The @0 marker in pmacros now can be placed in a position where
            there is no text (for example because the editor will purge the
            spaces at the end of line). It was the cause of a bug in Linux:
            after expanding a pmacro like "#d" the cursor was moved to the
            next line and another bug in DOS: the cursor was positioned in
            the \r. I don't know how dangerous was the DOS bug because I
            never saw the side effect but looks like a bad one. (Now the @0
            is stored as an X,Y coordinate).

19.07.1998: More adjustments in the places where the files are stored when
            running under Linux. Now the editor's enviroment variables are
            stored in ~/.setenvir.dat. The readme.1st file is loaded from
            SET_FILES.

19.07.1998: Now the editor restores the ALT+Fn console keys when it dies
            under Linux. I added a call to suspend_keyboard() in the
            routine that handles the hard signal.

19.07.1998: Fixed: The powered grep under Linux because it uses response
            files (not supported by bash). Now the editor writes an script
            and runs the script ;-)

21.07.1998: Version 0.4.17. 5th public release. Diffs sent to Robert. Linux
            release available in the web.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

26.07.1998: Applied parser v0.66 from Laszlo. It now supports expression,x
            to convert the expression into hexadecimal notation (o=octal,
            d=decimal and b=binary).

30.07.1998: Killed a bug in InfView introduced by the modifications made
            17.06.1998. In seekToNode(const char *Name).

30.07.1998: Added syntax help to the editor. (27-30). Similar to the RHIDE
            but with many improvements: Sort by score, a dialog to set up the
            list of nodes to search, information about the number of nodes
            from each file, etc.
            
01.08.1998: Added a progress bar in InfView, displayed when InfView loads a
            large index (20 seconds for rbint).

01.08.1998: Added syntax highlight for Perl submited by Daniel Mizyrycki
            (mdaniel@balug.org.ar).

02.08.1998: Added support for HP laser printers. Now the initialization
            string created by the HP button works with: LaserJet 4L, 5M,
            DeskJet 500+, 560C, 670 and I guess most of the Laser/DeskJet
            modern models. Problem reported by "Roger H." <rogerh40@aa.net>,
            solutions by: Roger, Mariano Alvarez Fernandez
            <malfer@teleline.es> and me.

08.08.1998: Added a primitive conditional support in the menu files to define
            menu options dependent of the OS.

08.08.1998: Added shortcuts for Grep and jump to function in the menu. Added
            various menu entries just to show the key to make the action and
            help new users. Added labels with the keys assigned to various
            commands specially in "Rectangle". Various changes in the menues.
            Jump to Function suggested by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>.
            Local/Global edition options repeated in Options suggested by
            Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>

08.08.1998: Added "Save As DOS" for Linux isn't very well tested, just tried
            and seems to work.

09.08.1998: Fixed a bug in the ISO-1 fonts. The editor was using &reg; for
            both &reg; and &copy; (HTML notation).

10.08.1998: Added a tool to convert accented characters to HTML tags. The
            editor used the HTML entities like Oacute. The tool takes in count
            the selected code page so it will work ala WYSIWYG. For example:
            The oacute of PC437 is the cents symbol in ISO-1 so if you call
            the tool while 437 is selected you'll get &oacute; but if you do
            it while ISO-1 is selected you'll get &cent;. I need it for my
            pages in spanish ;-) (9-10).

10.08.1998: Fixed: The TListViewer TVision's class to support code page
            remaping of the column separator character. Needed for the project
            window.

10.08.1998: Fixed: The project window now supports code page remapping.

11.08.1998: Adjusted: Some things in the syntax search. Enlarged the window to
            choose the match, now doesn't say that no matchs were found if you
            cancel and reduced the length for the info file name.

11.08.1998: Fixed: The progress bar now is "code page" friendly.

11.08.1998: Modified: Now the default screen saver for DOS>=7.00 (Winshit) is
            a text mode screen saver because a user reported problems when
            the editor switchs to graphics mode and is windowed. It works
            100% ok in most of the machines but I'm using a safe default. I
            hate winblows. Problem reported by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>
            and I saw an strange behavior (just ones) in the Alex's computer.

12.08.1998: Fixed: An annoying 'flash' when selecting in a line under edition
            and the old selection was hided. This was annoying me since I made
            the selection work with messages to avoid reading the shift state.

12.08.1998: Applied a patch from Robert to initialize Extention in SHLSelect
            of loadshl.cc.

12.08.1998: Fixed: Autoindent didn't take in count the first line of the file.
            (Reported by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>).

12.08.1998: Fixed: The way the editor copy text to the Windows clipboard. Now
            the clipboard is first erased and then the text is passed as OEM
            text instead of just text. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>,
            ideas for solutions by: Michael Mauch <michael.mauch@gmx.de> and
            Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.

12.08.1998: Fixed: Now using localtime instead of gmtime for the editor's
            clock. (Reported by Laszlo Molnar <molnarl@cdata.tvnet.hu>).

12.08.1998: Fixed: All the declarations of consts without specifying the type
            (default int) that's reported as a warning by egcs (not reported
            by gcc 2.7.x or 2.8.x). Reported by Andris Pavenis
            <pavenis@lanet.lv>. Some interesting things: to do it I did a
            masive search for 'const' using the grep tool of the editor I got
            910 lines in the message window and I opened 180 files using ALT+F8
            Wow!

13.08.1998: Fixed: InfView didn't take in count the last entry of the dir files
            created by Debian Linux, these files aren't true info files and
            hence needs some special treatment. Reported by Daniel Mizyrycki
            (mdaniel@balug.org.ar).

13.08.1998: Fixed: The routine that meassure the size of the nodes in InfView.
            I never saw a side effect but it had a potential flaw.

13.08.1998: Fixed: A problem in Save As UNIX. It used the maximun line width
            to allocate a temporal buffer in the stack but this value
            (limit.x) could be unsynchronized (is used only for the scroll
            bars) and in this case the stack was corrupted. Now I allocate it
            in the heap and check if the len is enough for each line, if not
            I realloc the buffer and adjust limit.x. Reported by Brett Porter
            <blp01@uow.edu.au>.
            Interesting Notes: was an interesting analisis of the trace back
            collected by the editor. Additionally Brett didn't lost the
            changes because the editor saved the buffer correctly in the error
            file.

16.08.1998: Fixed: a problem in the conditional menues (8/8/98). I was adding
            constant strings to a collection :-P, Linux free was upset.

16.08.1998: Fixed: Now the Linux version generates and uses the same desktop
            files that the DOS. I forgot to save/restore the palette
            information in the Linux version. It produced a SIGSEGV while
            loading DOS desktop files. Now v0.4.18 desktop files are
            compatible (DOS <-> Linux). The Linux version can load desktop
            files created with previous Linux versions but not with previous
            DOS versions.

16.08.1998: Fixed: a problem in the keyboard assigment routines. The bug was
            related to one variable (base) not updated after a realloc and
            hence becoming an invalid pointer. It was detected under Linux
            because in DOS the block wasn't reused and the content still
            valid.

16.08.1998: Fixed: The editor was saving the keybind.dat in the share
            directory instead of the home directory [Linux specific].

16.08.1998: Fixed: Another bug in the keyboard assigment routines. Yes
            another one not catched under DOS! Was in the CompactTable
            routine, a call to memcpy used "size" as size instead of "aux".

18.08.1998: Added: 22 new symbols to the fonts to support the things described
            in the next lines.

19.08.1998: Modified: Three TVision classes (TMenuBox, TIndicator and
            TRadioButtons) to support code pages.

19.08.1998: Enhanced the code page support to provide "similars" for codes
            under 32. That's needed for fonts like lat1-16.psf provided with
            Debian Linux. BTW: I think they are broken by design.

19.08.1998: Added: Two variants to the ISO-1 code page to match the lat1-16.psf
            and lat1u-16.psf Linux fonts. That's the first step toward the
            support of accents under Linux. (18-19).

28.08.1998: Added: Inferno 1 and Smoker 1 screen savers for DOS.

03.09.1998: Enabled the code page remaping stuff under Linux. Now is possible
            to see the ISO-8859-1 fonts in the screen without messing the
            frames. That's the final step of the things done in 18-19.08.
            (30-31.08).
            
03.09.1998: Fixed: I was writing in const chars when remapping the characters
            of the stars screen saver. In DOS that's OK, but Linux doesn't
            allow it because the strings are located in the CS.

03.09.1998: Version 0.4.19. Triggered by a new value saved (isReadOnly).

04.09.1998: Added: A mechanism to open more than one editor for the same file.
            The first opened is read/write the rest are read-only and shows an
            snapshot of the file at the time you opened it. Read-only editors can't
            be modified (at least I did my best to avoid it ;-) and can't be saved.
            The number of copies is 1 by default to emulate the old behavior, but
            can be modified from the general options menu. This value
            (TSetEditorApp::maxOpenEditorsSame) is saved in the desktop file so the
            version changed:
            Version 0.4.20. (3-4).

04.09.1998: Fixed: a bug in the v0.4.18 desktop files (thanks god this version wasn't
            distributed). In these files the last character of the syntax help data was
            saved as an integer and then the read routine reads a character. I
            discovered it when TSetEditorApp::maxOpenEditorsSame wasn't restored
            correctly. *NHP* (it means Never Hit People, that's because the bug was in
            a non-released version).

04.09.1998: Added: The editor windows that are read-only have and 'R' in the place where
            the modified editors have a star.
            ***** IMPORTANT ***** I did an internal change, now the editor class doesn't
            use a TIndicator, instead uses a TSIndicator. TSIndicators are derivated from
            TIndicator but have a pointer to the editor's owner and uses the data directly.
            It simplifies the things and gives more power to the indicator. So I did yet
            another change in the desktop files. Was hard to support the older ones because
            the old indicators are inserted in the Windows and I must remove and replace
            the indicator.
            Version 0.4.21.

05.09.1998: Fixed: A bug in TFileInfoPane that was writing out of the TDrawBuffer::data
            member when the path was >= 132 characters. Reported by: Daniel Horchner
            <dbjhorchner@hotmail.com>, Patch suggested by: Andris Pavenis
            <pavenis@lanet.lv>. As a result the TDrawBuffer module was rewrited.

06.09.1998: All TVision patches (10 and 19.08 and 05.09) sent to Robert.

08.09.1998: Fixed: 1) tfiledia.cc to create an input line (TFileInputLine) of PATH_MAX
            characters instead of just 79. 2) tfileinp.cc (TFileInputLine) to copy only
            maxLen+1 bytes instead of anything. Bug reported and studied by Andris Pavenis
            <pavenis@lanet.lv>.

09.09.1998: Fixed: a bug in the HTML accents (10.08.1998). The editor didn't jump to the
            start of the text it could unsinchronize the offset to the first line displayed
            in the screen messing the drawing. *NHP*.

09.09.1998: Sent the patchs of 08.09 to Robert. I think I sent some patches repeated.

09.09.1998: Fixed: A silly question like that: "The disk copy of  is newer, reload it?"
            triggered because the file didn't exist on disk (new file). RHIDE have the same
            stupid bug.

09.09.1998: Fixed: When saving a new file (untitled) if the new name already existed and
            you answered NO to overwrite the name was set anyways. So exiting and entering
            again you get 2 copies of the same file. I saw it while patching other stuff.

09.09.1998: Fixed: Under the same situation if you choosing as new name the name of the
            file already opened was posible, it created two copies of the same memory and
            unsynchronized. Now isn't allowed. The same bug exist in RHIDE.

09.09.1998: Modified: The internal way the editor calls the TCEditor::editorDialog member
            ***** IMPORTANT ***** The member points to the same type of function but the
            default dialogs provided in doedidia.cc are called with a different set of
            parameters. It must be take in count for RHIDE. More about it in the
            doEditDialogLocal function comment in editmain.cc. Was needed to hook the
            file overwrite warning to check if the new name belongs to an already opened
            file.

11.09.1998: Added: --project command line option to load an specific project file.
            Suggested by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>.

11.09.1998: Added: --help command line option to show the available options.

11.09.1998: Added: Support for macros from the menu so you can add menu items for different
            type of compilations. Suggested by Tomas Kouba <kouba@fzu.cz>.

12.09.1998: Modified: The tool to make the diffs is now a Perl script instead a C++ program
            the script is a little bit better and smaller but is slow and uses the file
            utils too much. Conclution: More flexible, faster to code but clearly inferior.
            makediff.cc and makediff.gpr removed from the source tree.

14.09.1998: Modified: Now the main project doesn't use small libraries, instead I'm
            using the new RHIDE feature of collecting the .o files living the Project
            Name in blank. It saves disk space and helps to integrate the editor with
            RHIDE.

14.09.1998: Fixed: Paste didn't update the the limit.x value. I think it was the reason
            that triggered the bug killed on 13.08.1998.

14.09.1998: Added: An 'R' to the read-only editors in the Windows List.

15.09.1998: Incorporated v0.4.17 to RHIDE 1.4.5.1 experimentally, for that I made some
            adjusts in the editor's code and a couple of patches in RHIDE. Diffs sent to
            Robert.

16.09.1998: Added: A new command cmcMouseToggle, that's specially designed for Linux,
            it just enable/disable the mouse (TMouse::suspend/resume), making that the
            user can switch between TVision behavior and default gpm behavior. So
            disabling the mouse and pressing the right button you can paste text from
            gpm or copy text from the screen to the gpm buffer; then pressing the same
            key sequence the mouse is controled by TVision again.
            Lamentably I didn't found any clipboard like routine in the gpm.info
            documentation.

24.09.1998: Added: A new sLisp command (WichEditor [n]). It just returns the name of the
            current editor. The parameter is currently limited to 0 or 1, 0 returns the
            name as-is and 1 without extention. Suggested by Tomas Kouba <kouba@fzu.cz>.

24.09.1998: Modified: Some internal stuff about TMLIEditor to simplify the things. Now I
            don't use a callback instead I use static members.

24.09.1998: Modified: Now the parser that looks for "errors" reported by external
            programs is more strict about the line number, it must be :nnnn: or will be
            rejected. I did it because "ls -la drive:/file" generates a fake error
            pattern.

30.09.1998: Fixed(?): A couple of bugs in the undo related to the fact that the editor
            purges the extra spaces in the lines. The undo still broken but I think I
            won't fix all in 0.4.x but in 0.5.x. There are potential problems when using
            tabs. To see the bugs in older versions just open a new C file, type /*,
            expand it, undo and see how it crash. The other: open a new file, type a
            letter, then a space, enter and try to undo. (Reported by Alex).

01.10.1998: Fixed: The keypad 4 key wasn't mapped to left arrow in my gkey.cc. Reported
            by Gili <sl@psycode.com>.

04.10.1998: Added: A command line switch to avoid hooking the mouse. It helps to run
            the editor under NT.

21.10.1998: Fixed: A bug in SDG, it failed if one of the project files was opened.

31.10.1998: Added: Four new values for the sLisp WhicEditor command (2 path, 3 drive,
            4 extention and 5 name without extention).
            Suggested by Tomas Kouba <kouba@fzu.cz>

31.10.1998: Fixed: A bug in recorded macros introduced by the new keyboard handling
            (well, new is just an expression it have 1 year ;-), the command associated
            to key strokes recorded wasn't initialized and hence had a random value
            producing random fails.

31.10.1998: Added (or fixed?): Now the recorded macros can record find, replace and
            find again actions. Reported by Burton Radons <loth@gec.net> (CA).

31.10.1998: Fixed: A bug in TestForPropagation accessing 1 line outside the lineLen
            array. I put conditionals in other places that makes access to this
            array checking the index. It produced a random SIGSEGV in Linux when
            opening a string (double quote). Robert detected it and sent a patch but
            I fixed it in a different way.

31.10.1998: Added: A new sLisp command called GetSelection it return the currently
            selected text. A user proposed it to get context help from an external
            program. Suggested by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.

31.10.1998: Added: Documentation for WhichEditor and GetSelection.

31.10.1998: Fixed: A bug in the sLisp interpreter when the code have errors inside
            a eval command that have more than one parameter. The interpreter didn't
            stop at the error and followed parsing with the error condition producing
            a crash.

01.11.1998: Added: Documentation for some old sLisp commands that I almost forgot. They
            are: left, right, substr, sstr, gstr and setv. And some commands not well
            documented: SendCommands, InsertText, defmacro, eval and Operator +.

01.11.1998: Fixed: a bug in setv sLisp command when an error ocurred in one of the
            parameters (crash). Similar to the one killed yesterday.

01.11.1998: Fixed: The tip of the day didn't advance when it was displayed
            in the message window. Reported by Alex.

01.11.1998: Added: Syntax highlight support for 8x51 assembler. Contributed by Alex.

01.11.1998: Fixed: The 9Xx34 video modes. The vertical display end was 480 instead of
            476 (14*34). Reported by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>.

01.11.1998: Fixed: Now after running SDG the editor checks if any of the files under
            edition was modified and asks for reload. Normal case if you are taking
            a look to the output file ;-)

01.11.1998: Fixed: A bug when parsing macros.slp: if a function was commented it failed.
            (The editor reports the error but RHIDE crashes ?!)

01.11.1998: Fixed: In Linux when pressing Ctrl+RightArrow and editing a DOS file the
            editor stopped in the last character of the line (no move to the next).
            Reported by Andris Pavenis <pavenis@lanet.lv>.

01.11.1998: Fixed: In the InfView when incrementally typing a name of a node if the
            currently selected link was 0 (none) the editor was accessing to the -1
            element of an array. I saw the crash in Linux and I guess Daniel reported
            it before but wasn't able to explain how to reproduce.

02.11.1998: Modified: The Linux distribution is in .tar.gz format now. Already planned
            and Ivan claimed for it ;-))

02.11.1998: Fixed: The screen savers weren't triggered under Linux in the 0.4.21 alpha.
            Reported by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

02.11.1998: Fixed: The Syntax Help (Ctrl+F1) failed with info files where the node name
            is different of the name of the function. That's the case of glibc. Reported
            by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

02.11.1998: Fixed: Now the change directory and palette customization menu options
            doesn't appear under Linux because they aren't ported.
            Reported by Ivan Baldo.

02.11.1998: Added: Support for internationalization under Linux using glibc2's gettext.

03.11.1998: Fixed: updateflags wasn't initialized. I think it was the reason of a blank
            character drawed in new files drawed randomly from time to time.

03.11.1998: Fixed: a bug in the match pair repainting that painted wrong text after a
            whole redraw was done. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.

03.11.1998: Fixed: when selecting "Open Info" button from the InfView control dialog
            produced a SIGSEGV under Linux because the editor was trying to write in
            a constant string (allocated in code segment).

03.11.1998: Added: Linux: when Alt or AltGr is pressed the control of the mouse is let
            to gpm so the user can use it to copy/paste. Was suggested by various Linux
            users because that's what mc does.

04.11.1998: Added: That's a potential source of bugs but I think is a needed feature:
            Now the editor reads the attributes of the file before editing it and
            after a save the attributes are restored to this value. In this way hidden
            DOS files and executable UNIX files are preserved. The DOS attribute called
            Archive is set to 1 *ever* because it means the file changed since the
            last backup. The default attributes for Linux are 644, that's the same I
            got before modifying the routines so I guess is OK, but it could be an
            option. Now under DOS hidden and system files doesn't report a wrong
            message telling they are "read-only", that's a feature(?) of djgpp's libc
            to prevent users writing system sensitive files but is silly from my point
            of view. A new member "mode_t ModeOfFile;" was created to hold this
            information.

05.11.1998: Fixed: If the file had a fake Emacs like mode signaled with "mode:name", for
            example the loadshl.cc itself, the file ends without highlight. Now in this
            case the editor tries with the extension.

05.11.1998: Added: support for -\*-mode:C;tab-width:8-\*- (note I escaped * ;-) settings.
            In this case the editor will use C syntax highlight and set the tabSize to 8.
            So now users can even use it as a feature of the editor.

06.11.1998: Added: transparent support for gzip compressed files. Currently it only works
            OK if the editor is linked with zlib. The compressed files are decompressed
            to a temporal because the editor then analize the \r\n or \n mode. When saving
            the editor just writes the compressed file using zlib. (5-6)

06.11.1998: Added: An option to run external programs switching the screen because if the
            external program destroys the screen content the editor won't repaint.

11.11.1998: Fixed: A bug in InfView when using local messages larger than the english
            version. Patch by Robert.

11.11.1998: Version 0.4.22 because a new option is saved and I released a couple of 0.4.21
            versions (Ivan Baldo and www.linux.org.ar have these copies).

11.11.1998: Fixed: The Linux version didn't respond to the code page broadcast because the
            code was under a #ifdef __DJGPP__. Reported by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

11.11.1998: Fixed: Some stuff in INSTALL.LINUX and other scripts. Suggested by Ivan Baldo.

11.11.1998: Fixed: Four errors in editor.tx documentation source that stopped makeinfo
            1.68 compiling the HTML docs. Reported by Andris. (Texinfo v3.12).

12.11.1998: Fixed: "Powered Grep" handled wrong links to directories because (1) They can
            be recursive and (2) We can't return to the previous directory with cd ..
            An example is the /usr/linux of my machine where /usr/linux/ncurses points to
            /usr/linux.

12.11.1998: Added: Now InfView shows some progress signs while searching. I added it
            because with large info files you could think the editor is hanged.

12.11.1998: Added: Copy and Paste buttons in the calculator dialog to make it more evident.

19.11.1998: Fixed: The message box wasn't updated when the first message was displayed.

19.11.1998: Fixed: Now all the items in Alt+L have shortcuts and they aren't repeated. I
            used numbers because I exhausted the letters of some words. International
            messages must be updated.

19.11.1998: Added: Now Alt+F7/F8 jumps to the next match, not the next line in the
            messsage window.

20.11.1998: Fixed: The compressed flags wasn't initialized in "new files" from disk. *NHP*

20.11.1998: Added: Copyright labels to almost all the files using a Perl script. That's
            because I'm planing to make coherent the copyright, it means: editor and
            InfView GPL and support libraries LGPL.

03.12.1998: Fixed: I was dereferencing the indicator * without checking it for NULL. It
            affected the read block operation that creates an editor without indicator
            and scroll bars. I overlooked it thanks to the brother billy, f*ck. *NHP*.

03.12.1998: Modified: Now the backup policy changed totally. What I was using: (1) move the
            original file to xxxx.bkp (2) create a new file (3) set the attributes of this
            file to reflect the original ones. What I'm doing now: (1) *copy* the original
            file to xxxx.bkp (2) set the attributes of the backup (3) truncate the original
            file (4) store the text. That's a lot better because: (1) The creation time
            isn't altered (2) It works for symlinks. (2) is the most important because I
            want to try to unify the DOS and Linux sources but to make it I'll use symlinks.
            I hope it won't introduce a serious bug ;-)

04.12.1998: Added: Some highlight support for Java files. Contributed by Louis Paul
            Santillan <lsantil@calstatela.edu>.

04.12.1998: Modified: That isn't the exact date but now I use libz in Linux.
