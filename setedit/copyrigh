  SET's editor is a very complex program. It currently have more than 1.45Mb
of source code and uses various libraries. It makes the copyright and terms
of distribution very complex.
  Here is a description of the copyrights of each part:
  [Each of these parts are independent so have independent copyrights]

bzip2/libbzip2 version 1.0 of 21 March 2000

---------- libmpegsound -----------------------------------------------------
It provides the default MP3 engine. I took it from the splay Debian package
and it says:

Not included in this package but needed to create the editor:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------- TurboVision v2.0 -------------------------------------------------

  Copyright (c) 1994 by Borland International
  All Rights Reserved.
  It was then released in the Borland's web site. According to Borland's FAQ
this is Public Domain.

  This library is freely available from (original):
  ftp://ftp.borland.com/pub/borlandcpp/devsupport/archive/turbovision/tv.zip

  The port was done by Robert Hîhne and currently I'm the maintainer, you
can get the port (under the GPL license)
  http://tvision.sourceforge.net/


---------- GetText ----------------------------------------------------------

  When you compile the patched TurboVision with international support (you
can avoid it) you must link with this library covered by the LGPL license.


---------- Allegro ----------------------------------------------------------

  Copyright (c) by Shawn Hargreaves, 1994-2001

   Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in 
   cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, 
   redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do 
   not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product 
   you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro 
   community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful 
   bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just 
   releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from 
   them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it 
   would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you 
   are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.

Note: Shawn knows I did my part ;-), from the authors file of Allegro:
   Salvador Eduardo Tropea (salvador@inti.edu.ar).
   Improved the keyboard routines (better handling of extended scancodes, 
   keyboard LED support, capslock and numlock, and alt+numpad input), 
   contributed the 320x100 VGA graphics mode, added support for proper 16 
   bit sample mixing, and made numerous other useful suggestions, 
   contributions and bugfixes.

---------- LibIOStream and LibStdCxx ----------------------------------------

Licensing terms for `libio'
===========================

   Since the `iostream' classes are so fundamental to standard C++, the
Free Software Foundation has agreed to a special exception to its
standard license, when you link programs with `libio.a':

     As a special exception, if you link this library with files
     compiled with a GNU compiler to produce an executable, this does
     not cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
     General Public License.  This exception does not however
     invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
     covered by the GNU General Public License.

   The code is under the GNU General Public License (version 2) for all
other purposes than linking with this library; that means that you can
modify and redistribute the code as usual, but remember that if you do,
your modifications, and anything you link with the modified code, must
be available to others on the same terms.

   These functions are also available as part of the `libg++' library;
if you link with that library instead of `libio', the GNU Library
General Public License applies.


---------- ncurses ---------------------------------------------------------
library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was written by Pavel
Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal@netcom.com>. Ncurses is
copyright (C) 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 by Zeyd M. Ben-Halim.

Pavel Curtis released his original copyright on this software to the
public domain, but Zeyd M. Ben-Halim has retained the copyright on his
version of this software.

	Permission is hereby granted to reproduce and distribute ncurses
	by any means and for any fee, whether alone or as part of a
	larger distribution, in source or in binary form, PROVIDED
	this notice is included with any such distribution, not removed
	from header files, and is reproduced in any documentation
	accompanying it or the applications linked with it.

	ncurses comes AS IS with no warranty, implied or expressed.

Note: Only used for Linux version.

License Details
===============

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

    The registry access code is from The RegDos Group's Regdos library.
Alfons Hoogervorst <alfons@hoogervorst.demon.nl> is the maintainer of
this. I think RegDos can be obtained from http://www.hoogervorst.demon.nl.

Note: Also used in the installer.
---------- Terminus Font ----------------------------------------------------
The terminus font is Copyright (C) 2002 Dimitar Zhekov

The font is distributed using a GPL program. I took the shapes from the
Debian package generated using the X (pcf) fonts.
I also changed some shapes of this font.
---------- X Font -----------------------------------------------------------
The XFont.sft file was created using the XFree86 misc fonts.

They say: Public domain font. Share and enjoy.
So the SFT files for X Fonts are also Public Domain.
---------- Rest of the fonts ------------------------------------------------
The rest of the fonts come from raw files floating around the net without
any copyright in them.
As they are shapes I don't think anybody can really claim rights over them.
I found references in internet that follows the following rationale: The
shapes itself can be freely used, otherwise the owner could ask for royalties
over the printed/displayed output produced by the shapes. Just imagine
somebody trying to ask news papers to pay for each character printed or
similar silly things. That's why what companies protect are names or specific
formats, but not the shapes itself.
I don't know how accurate is this, for this reason I put clear the origin of
each font.

                                 Summary
*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************

  As you can see the stuff is very complex. As I'm using LGPL libraries
(gettext and some of my own libraries) the resulting editor is covered by
the GNU GPL license.
  But it doesn't go in the reverse, I mean: it doesn't force me to distribute
copyrighted libraries like Turbo Vision.
  Additionally even when I release my work I reserve my rights to use it in a
commercial project and don't distribute this particular version. It doesn't
imposse any special restriction to the currently available version that is
covered by the GPL license.
  Here is a summary of what the GPL implies:

* You can use the source.
* You can modify the source.
* You can distribute the source.
* You can make a commercial program and charge for it.
* You must make the derivative work available for all the people, you can
only charge the costs to distribute it.
* You can not delete the original copyright.
* If you modify a source you must put it clear.

  Read the license carefully, the above is just an inaccurate summary.
  Note that even when you can use the code for a commercial application you
must make the sources available so the things becomes a little bit complex
for you.

 Even when isn't strictly needed I ask the following:

* If you include it in a CD ROM please let me know. If you are a big company
you could send me a copy.
* If you use it for any purpose let me know so I'll be able to include this
information in my curriculum.
* If you really like the editor and/or the SET's Documentation Generator
included on it you can send me anything as feedback.
  If you want to send money I'll be happy, but if you don't have it and
want to show your gratitude you can send me a postal card from your city
or some of the things I collect (train tickets, cigarette envelopes and
boxes, stamps, old money and coins).
