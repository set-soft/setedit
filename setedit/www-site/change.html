<HTML><Title>change.log for setedit</Title><Body>$Log$<br><b>Revision</b> 1.617  2004/09/24 18:59:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The SF Rev 1.523 patch about holidays clean-up was buggy. It
released the loaded stuff but didn't indicate it. So when opening the
calendar again the code used freed memory.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.616  2004/09/23 19:45:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [sLisp] edf* constants not working. The WinDebugger definition was
unsorted. Reported by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.615  2004/09/23 19:19:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [RPMs] Problems to generate the RPMs using Red Hat 9.0. The
changes introduced by bbcat should be enough (they are for Fedora Core 2),
but more is needed to avoid problems with RH9.0. The problems are related
to the generation of a RPM file with debug info.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.614  2004/09/23 19:05:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [BC++] The last change to support pcre/pcre.h needed changes in
the configed.h file for Win32.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.613  2004/09/22 18:45:13  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [NHP] isDisassemblerEditor not initialized when loading from disk.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.612  2004/09/20 14:16:01  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] When you compile for "Debug" the compiler disables *all*
the optimizations. Including the dead code. For this reason MSVC also needs
fake references.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.611  2004/09/20 14:13:03  set<br>
<li> Added: [Config] A command line option to specify a path for includes.
This path is used for the configuration tests and for the editor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.610  2004/09/17 20:52:41  set<br>
<li> Added: [WWW] Some changes towards the next release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.609  2004/09/17 18:51:55  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] Another min/max mix. Reported by Arnold.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.608  2004/09/17 16:38:35  set<br>
<li> Added: [Cygwin] Workaround for bugs in Cygwin's perl. Cygwin is
configured to use DOS files, but when parsing DOS files you must match the
/r char. DJGPP implementation is much more cleaver about it.<br>
<li> Added: [Cygwin] libmigdb detection.<br>
<li> Note: Current status of the editor using brand new Cygwin is "compile but
the resulting binary is useless". Note that while compiling the editor I
got SIGSEGVs from Perl and bash. It looks like Cygwin still alpha, at least
for Windows 98 SE.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.607  2004/09/17 16:25:59  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Config] Now the .po files are regenerated only if the user
configures enabling the maintainer mode. This should reduce CVS collisions.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.606  2004/09/17 16:09:46  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] An advice dialog when debugging in the Linux console
indicating the program will be started in another VT. Also some explanation
about it in the docs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.605  2004/09/16 20:59:51  set<br>
<li> Added: [Config] AMD64 and NetBSD detection. It doesn't mean they are
supported.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.604  2004/09/15 13:10:06  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Config] wrong pcre header selected when using shipped pcre.
Problem introduced by the recent patch to support pcre/pcre.h.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.603  2004/09/14 19:01:11  set<br>
<li> Added: [Config] Message warning about the lack of debug support.<br>
<li> Added: [Distrib] The list of added/fixed things. 66 new things and 40
fixes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.602  2004/09/10 19:55:06  set<br>
<li> Modified: To include libmigdb in the distro (if available).<br>
<li> Modified: [Config] To use the shipped libmigdb if none installed.<br>
<li> Modified: [Config] To detect installations where pcre header is in the
pcre directory. Red Hat seems to use it according to Vik Heyndrickx.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.601  2004/09/10 18:11:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Debug and InfView stuff to redmond.smn. InfView stuff to
simple.smn.<br>
<li> Added: [i18n] Data Window menu and missing debug menu entries to
editmenu.cc.<br>
<li> Updated: [i18n] Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.600  2004/09/09 20:47:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] various menu entries associated to dialogs that didn't
indicate it using "...".<br>
<li> Added: [i18n] various debug menu entries to editmenu.cc so they can be
translated.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.599  2004/09/08 20:19:43  set<br>
<li> Added: [DOC] More debug documentation, now the core functionality is
documented.<br>
<li> Added: [Help] Linked debug help contexts to the documentation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.598  2004/09/08 18:14:32  set<br>
<li> Added: [SHL] For SPARC assembler.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] syntax highlight for SPARC targets. Now the code can be
adapted to other architectures with minor changes. Also tested stack window
on an Ultra 60 machine.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.597  2004/09/07 20:00:02  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Support for the Stack Window on SPARC machines. Not
tested.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] The disassembler window to hide tabs and use 8 as tab
size.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.596  2004/09/06 17:15:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Problems with the registers list when using gdb 6.x.
That's a workaround for gdb bug "mi/1770".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.595  2004/09/06 16:25:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [RHIDE] Another name collision (InsertEnviromentVar).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.594  2004/09/06 13:30:20  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] cmInspect command collision with RHIDE's command. Reported
by Vik Heyndrickx <v/pandora/be>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.593  2004/09/01 20:24:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] cmDWGotoAddress doesn't have to validate if the address
is valid, that's just a reference.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] cmDWFollowPointer and cmDWFollowPtnNew failed because gdb
interpreted "*0xXXXX" as just "0xXXXX". To avoid it and also avoid the
mechanism we use to "take the address of"<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Wrong state displayed in the Debug Window after closing
the debug session and making it visible.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Moved Data Window commands cmDWBaseIncrement and
cmDWBaseDecrement to the movement submenu.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Documentation for all the debug commands. Help contexts
isn't linked, yet.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.592  2004/08/30 15:34:05  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Tags] Abort when doing word completion and the starting word was
"bigger" than the last tag in the list. Reported by Juan Pablo.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.591  2004/08/27 18:27:00  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Data Window commands not enabled after recycling a data
window.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Data Window: Fill, Clear and Move operations didn't
update the changes.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Data Window: Explicit error when trying to use a block
of more than 1 MB. Warning about speed for more than 128 KB. Not sure if
those limits are good.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Option to don't show again to 3 of the confirmations about
closing the debug session and killing the debuggee.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Advice about setting debug options without a project.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Data Window: When entering a wrong value in the block
operations now we go back to the dialog so the user can fix the wrong
value instead of entering all again.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Data Window: Warning about empty fields in the dialog
for addresses. This is much more descriptive than an error from gdb ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.590  2004/08/26 20:49:05  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] Calls to min/max with different arguments (unsigned vs
signed). They generate errors with MSVC 6.0. Patch by Arnold.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.589  2004/08/25 20:51:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Crash when gdb failed to report registers. Found because
a bug in gdb CVS 2004-08-25.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] TDataWindow go to new address not working.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] CPU line disapearing when setting a breakpoint in other
line.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] "Go to cursor" for the disassembler window.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Made more robust the code that disassembles. Now we first
try to solve the function name and if it can be solved we use it otherwise
we disassemble from the current code. We also check if the distance
between the start of the function and the current point isn't huge, some
times gdb fails to detect the real function.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Command to detach from "PID target".<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] The Run/Continue to also mean "Atach"<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.588  2004/08/24 21:17:53  set<br>
<li> Added: [DOC] More documentation about debug features.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Cosmetic] Some menu entries that opens dialogs to indicate "..."<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Avoid asking for confirmation when closing a debug
session that isn't stopped nor running.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] If gdb failed to disassembler code we shortly SIGSEGVed in
the idle update.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] The debug options dialog didn't return success.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.587  2004/08/24 13:16:38  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] A couple of typos in new code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.586  2004/08/24 00:01:16  set<br>
<li> Added: [config] libmigdb version detection.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.585  2004/08/23 15:54:41  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] The way the linker is called from the makefile. Arnold
Wiegert's patch.<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] Lack of Boolean cast in ceditor.cc. From Arnold.<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] Lack of bool definition in pphp.c. From Arnold.<br>
<li> Fixed: [RPMs] Wrong directive in specs. Patch from bbcat.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.584  2004/08/22 22:45:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Debug Window, Watches Window, Inspector Windows and
Data Windows now saves not only its current size but also the "unzoomed"
size.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] Inspectors can't be closed while "running".<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Now when we add a file to the project its path is added
to the list of paths for sources.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] When we add a path to the list of sources paths the path
is also passed to gdb.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] The code to enable MI v2. Currently it only helps
inspectors making them much faster.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] The code to disable the psym search workaround for the bug
in gdb. It will allow faster startup when the bug is fixed without needing
to change the editor.<br>
<li> Added: [Tags] Busy indicator while we load the tags from disk.
Lamentably only the X11 driver implements it.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] The way "ignore" is interpreted: it means the times
the breakpoint will be ignored when starting the program or when modifying
or setting the breakpoint.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Instead of reporting "OK" as an error now we explain
the operation can't be performed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.583  2004/08/20 16:10:53  set<br>
<li> Added: [WWW] Links to the DOS precompiled snapshots.<br>
<li> Added: [WWW] Image showing the editor debugging itself.<br>
<li> Fixed: [RPM] Problems to create the rpms using Fedora Core 2. Patch by
bbcat.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.582  2004/08/19 18:07:39  set<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] Its own menu.<br>
<li> Modified: [InfView] Alt+B and Alt+I shortcuts to avoid menu collisions.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.581  2004/08/18 14:15:42  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [BC++] Lack of sys/time.h used in debug.cc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.580  2004/08/18 14:14:47  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [gcc] Some gcc 3.4.1 requirements:
1) Default argument values for function pointers no longer allowed.
2) Missing string header in one of the screen savers.
3) Passing pointers to packed struct elements no longer supported.
4) vsync collision with allegro, didn't annoy gcc 2.9x<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.579  2004/08/17 15:06:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [config] wrong makeinfo 4.7 detection. Patch by Andrea.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] missing dummies to compile without debug code.<br>
<li> Updated: [i18n] spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.578  2004/08/16 21:24:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed+Modified: The "paste" operation for TInputLinePiped views. Now the
text is pasted without destroying the previous value (unless it is selected).
The old mechanism was broken when linking to the Unicode branch of TV because
the way it changed the "data" member was incomplete.<br>
<li> Added: [Tags] an option to regenerate the central file. Some times ctags
fails in the generation of incremental files and lets bogus registers. They
can be very annoying and in this case the best is to just regenerate the
whole file from scratch.<br>
<li> Fixed: The list for word completion had a wrong vertical size when we had
repeated tags in the list to choose. Only one was visible but the size was
computed counting the repetitions.<br>
<li> Modified: If the list of items in the word completion list box isn't bigger
than the list's height we no longer add a useless scroll bar.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Disassembler window!!! a cute one ;-) It have an editor so
you can see the assembler with syntax highlight. If the information about
the source code is available it also shows the source code mixed with the
assembler.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Optional key for the "add with scope" in the Watches Window.<br>
<li> Modified: DynStrCat* to accept NULL pointer for initialization and take
const char * arguments.<br>
<li> Added: Moved the newStrL function from a static place to a public header,
that's very useful.<br>
<li> Modified: The way openEditor works when using oedNoSelect flag. It should
be better but could affect the message window browsing.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.577  2004/08/13 20:49:21  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] +/- keys in the inspector gives problems when using
italian keyboards and Linux console. So now + can be replaced by E and -<br>by C (Expand/Collapse). Both work so the user can choose.<br>
<li> Modified: [Debug] Added more error checking to the inspectors creation.
A bug in gdb makes it die when evaluating some expressions. So now the code
checks it and goes to "disconnected" state. It will need much more adjusts
before a gdb crash doesn't affect the editor.<br>
<li> Both from Andrea's reports.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.576  2004/08/13 19:01:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] txt generation details when using makeinfo 4.7. From more
info provided by Andrea.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.575  2004/08/13 18:10:17  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Options to configure: gdb binary, xterm binary, main
function, max. number of lines in debug window, gdb response time
out and disable gdb banner.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] The messages in the debug window are limited in
number and cleared when a new session is started.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] A dialog to ask if we want to wait more when a time
out in gdb response is detected. Not tested.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.574  2004/08/12 21:07:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] if we specified a path for sources when gdb wasn't running
the editor crashed. It was only from the dialog to specify a file.<br>
<li> Added: The "FindFile" function now also looks for the filename alone. So
if we look for ./examples/ex3d.c FindFile will try with it and then with
ex3d.c alone.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] frames of the available threads and also selection of
current thread by default. So it can be used to display current threads.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.573  2004/08/11 21:06:29  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Select thread option. But this is quite useless. GDB
doesn't report any info, just the ID and doesn't remove finished threads
from the list. Which is worst: selecting a finished thread doesn't return
any error, the message is printed in the console. Yet another bug in gdb.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] An option to delete all the breakpoints, watchpoints, etc.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] When adding a watchpoint the word under cursor is used as
starting point.<br>
<li> Fixed: cmcCutClipWin command not dis/enabled when selecting text.
Reported by Arnold Wiegert.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.572  2004/08/11 16:30:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] More makeinfo 4.7 details. From Andrea's feedback.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.571  2004/08/11 15:08:37  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Persistence to the Data Windows. Of course they need to be
"recycled".<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Shortcuts for "Run/Continue", "Inspectors" and "Calling
Stack". The first could need to be exchanged with SDG shortcut, not sure.
The other two are the same used in RHIDE.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.570  2004/08/10 19:56:45  set<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] A dialog asking for the file location when it couldn't be
located in the current path for sources. It have a similar behavior to what
RHIDE does.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] The "calling stack" command crashed if the functions were
located at different files.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] The "calling stack" to add "solved filenames", not the
names returned by gdb.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] The "calling stack" to jump to the "frame 1"<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] When deleting recycled inspectors we deleted the "fake"
tree twice.<br>
<li> Added: [Debug] Now the data window disables all its commands when they
can't be used.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debug] In one of the last optimizations in the watches window I
forgot to redraw the window, so it looked like no item changed until we
selected it.<br>
<li> Fixed: Leak in TPrjItemColl::addFile when trying to verify if a file
existed.<br>
<li> Fixed: Leak in the TMultiMenuBar when the selected menu wasn't the first
in the list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.569  2004/08/09 23:50:42  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Cosmetic] The multi menu bar to avoid drawing the first menu
and quickly switch to the default one (the last in the list).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.568  2004/08/09 21:21:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] @xref in sdg.tx without period.<br>
<li> Fixed: DOS' end of file in djmdr.s.<br>
<li> Both from Oswald.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.567  2004/08/09 20:59:24  set<br>
<li> Added: Context sensitive menues. Also extended the .smn file language to
create such a thing. Currently used only for the data window.<br>
<li> Fixed: Problems in the data window when trying to display the ASCII 0.
Also modified to show the full characters range, not just ASCII range.<br>
<li> Fixed: Data Window doing 2 reads when created.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.566  2004/08/09 15:14:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] Problems in the HTML generation using makeinfo 4.7.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] Problems in the DVI/PS generation (macro name collision).
Again from info sent by Andrea Mazzoleni (amadvance/users/sourceforge/net).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.565  2004/08/09 12:54:47  set<br>
<li>** Data Window stuff:<br>
<li>** Related to the new code<br>
<li> Fixed: isValidUL not working.<br>
<li> Fixed: No input box when starting from a value from the "word under
cursor"<br>
<li> Added: Implemented the memory write.<br>
<li> Added: Error message to indicate a memory location can't be accessed when
validating it. No silent fail.<br>
<li> Added: Stack Window.<br>
<li> Added: TDskWin wrapper.<br>
<li> Added: Update when debuggy stops.<br>
<li> Modified: EnterAddresses to show input lines without separation.<br>
<li>** Also related to the original code<br>
<li> Fixed: The FIXMEs about using smaller blocks.<br>
<li> Fixed: Buffer to hold selected file name wasn't as long as PATH_MAX
(SIGSEGV).<br>
<li> Fixed: Lack of update after reading from a file.<br>
<li> Fixed: Creation of empty files if the from or length was wrong.<br>
<li> Fixed: When debugging two programs with different endian types without
exiting the code taked only the first. Now it should work, but is hard to
check ;-)<br>
<li> Fixed: The stack window first detects the target architecture, if it
isn't x86 gives an error.<br>
<li> Fixed: Wrong color and frame of the indicator when the window wasn't
selected.<br>
<li> Added: ESC closes the window.<br>
<li> Added: An attribute to show memory changes, that's really nice because
you can see what changed in each program step very quickly.<br>
<li> Modified: When updating the memory modified cells are now reset to "not
edited"<br>
<li> Modified: Removed %#lx in favor of 0x%lx, I think that's more portable.
I encapsulated most of these printfs in one member.<br>
<li> Modified: All the stuff about a linked list of windows, now they update
itself using the broadcast that indicates the debugger changed its state.
I keep a counter of windows to avoid sending a broadcast to nobody ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.564  2004/08/06 21:10:36  set<br>
<li> Added: A first part of the Molnar Laszlo's "Data Window v0.1" that he
contributed to RHIDE. A lot of things must be solved because things are
quite different when you can directly access the debuggy memory :-(<br>
<li> Fixed: A couple of leaks that happened when closing a project and loading
another. Reported by Valgrind while debugging the "Data Window" stuff.<br>
<li> Note: The debugging stuff is quite functional, Inspectors are great for
complex structures like trees. But the whole thing isn't stable, more
adjusts are needed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.563  2004/08/05 19:26:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed(?): [DOC] The complement part of the "@end menu" makeinfo 4.7
problem. This time for the @itemize.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOC] newer versions of the TeX package defines "html" macro which
collides with the one in rhidemac.*.<br>
<li> Added: [DOC] SDH command line option to avoid numbering chapters. It
looks like makeinfo 4.7 does it by itself (and by default!).
From info sent by Andrea Mazzoleni (amadvance/users/sourceforge/net).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.562  2004/08/05 18:14:21  set<br>
<li> Modified: [sLisp] CommentIndent macro, enhanced version from Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.561  2004/08/04 20:09:47  set<br>
<li> Added: Inspectors!!! They are quite different to the RHIDE inspectors.
They are suitable for complex structures and you can have various in the
desktop.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.560  2004/08/02 15:23:03  set<br>
<li> Fixed: makeinfo 4.7 enforces the use of @pxref for (@x{...}).<br>
<li> Fixed(?): makeinfo 4.7 no longer supports "@end xxxx" commands inside
macros :-( so I added an aditional intermediate file to avoid them.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.559  2004/08/02 13:22:41  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] CommentIndent macro contributed by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.558  2004/08/02 12:50:45  set<br>
<li> Added: Watchpoints!!!! now we can easily hunt wild writes ;-)<br>
<li> Modified: The breakpoints are moved only if the target changed its time
stamp.<br>
<li> Added: i18n to the debug dialogs.<br>
<li> Fixed: i18n of the project window title.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.557  2004/08/02 12:44:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When going step by step and the "match pair on the fly" was
enabled the code to restore the highlighted pairs did a mess with the
background color if the pair involved a "CPU line".<br>
<li> Added: After using "Run a program" the editor updates the moved
breakpoints. Also an option to disable it. Note: That's what made me create
the splines, lamentably Robert never used them for RHIDE.<br>
<li> Added: A beep when "Run a program" finishes. Option to disable.<br>
<li> Added: Close the debug session before running the external program. An
option to disable it. That's needed for OSs where we can't overwrite opened
files and is also needed to woraround gdb bugs.<br>
<li> Added: Option to ask for confirmation if the "Run program" will kill the
current debug session.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] edfRunStopDebug option to RunProgram.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.556  2004/07/30 21:10:17  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the cmc*Win (Copy,Cut,Paste) commands are called cmc*OS to
reflect their real use. The old names remains as aliases. From a suggestion
by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: Ins,Del,+,- shortcuts in the status line for the breakpoints
dialog.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] new command GetSystemInfo to know the current OS, TV
driver, CPU, etc. From a suggestion by Thiago.<br>
<li> Updated: docs, not yet the debug stuff.<br>
<li> Fixed: Error in the SpLines search that made funny things when trying to
toggle a breakpoint (introduced during the structure change).<br>
<li> Added: The dialog to add a "watch" now is piped to an editor and the word
under cursor is used. It also have a history (shared with evaluate).<br>
<li> Added: A history to the dialog to send gdb commands.<br>
<li> Modified: The "CPU line" is centered only if we jumped to another source.
It is less annoying.<br>
<li> Added: The conditionals in menu files can use the TV driver, CPU, OS,
etc. for conditions. From a suggestion by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: $define and $undef and its expansion in menu files. From a
suggestion by Thiago.<br>
<li> Fixed: The commands to select the watches and debug window are
independent of the debugger state.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.555  2004/07/29 20:33:37  set<br>
<li> Added: The edit breakpoint dialog now disables the unneeded options. So
if you will specify the location using file:line then you can't say the
function or address.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.554  2004/07/28 21:03:23  set<br>
<li> Added: The second part of the "Breakpoints" dialog. Now is possible to
add, modify, remove, enable, disable and jump to breakpoit locations. Some
details remains to be adjusted and is lightly tested.<br>
<li> Fixed: A leak in SpLines, the new structures needs atFree and not just
atRemove, found using valgrind, debugged using the editor. Note: gdb is
quite bad and is sooooo buggy, now that I'm using it from the editor I can
verify when the problem is in gdb and that's too common :-(<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.553  2004/07/26 20:36:03  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now breakpoints and frames are searched in the "path for
sources" and not only in the binary reference.<br>
<li> Modified: "Go To Line" now passes the full qualified name of the file to
gdb. With both changes I debugged "rhgdb".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.552  2004/07/26 16:06:40  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MSVC] The WinNT/configed.h header to report "MSC" as compiler
for MS compiler. Suggested by Arnold.<br>
<li> Updated: Copyright year in main about box. Suggested by Arnold.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.551  2004/07/26 15:35:37  set<br>
<li> Modified: Once again makeinfo breaks something. This time makeinfo 4.6
doesn't like:
@item xxxx @il{xxxx
yyyy}
The @il must end in the same line or makeinfo gets confused.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.550  2004/07/26 15:09:15  set<br>
<li> Added: The first part of the "Breakpoints" dialog. Currently you can
just see the breakpoint.<br>
<li> Fixed: SpLineGetOldValueOf to match not only the position but also the
spline id.<br>
<li> Fixed: All the TCEditor::SetSpecialLines logic because it was wrong and
it needed adjustments to the new structures.<br>
<li> Modified: Moved all the breakpoint operations to a class so we can use
it for a dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.549  2004/07/26 15:04:10  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<br>
<li> Fixed(?): The last modification to the special lines stuff had a major
flaw. If we keep a copy in the TCEditor then is quite hard to know which
lines were moved. I changed the insternal structures used by SpLinMan to
solve it. The code changed too much to be considered stable.<br>
<li> Modified: The internac/Makefile to update the translations every time a
source that have strings to translate is modified. This will increase cvs
traffic but will reduce collisions.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.548  2004/07/23 21:22:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] The set_new_handler() function of MSVC 4.0 doesn't support
NULL. It is possible to use _set_new_handler(), but as it is only tested
for gcc I'm disabling this code for other compilers. From a report by
Arnold. Note: with it Arnold compiled the editor for MSVC 4.0.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.547  2004/07/23 20:53:22  set<br>
<li> Added: Configuration options to disable the calculator and calendar.
Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Modified: Optimized cmcMoveBlock. Suggested by Oswald. Consider it
unstable.<br>
<li> Modified: The meassure commanand to report the result in the status line.
Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Modified: The insertBuffer member to support some copies from the same
buffer.<br>
<li> Fixed: Leak in tags code. Reported by valgrind.<br>
<li> Added: Options to zoom the editor windows when inserted in the desktop.
Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Fixed: Bug in stack position. Forgot to unlink the returned objects.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.546  2004/07/23 13:00:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] Wrong prototype of LoadFileUnderCursor in ced_inte.h. Only
reported by MSVC 4.0. From a report by Arnold.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.545  2004/07/22 00:59:15  set<br>
<li> Added: When using the tag search if we find a perfect match now we jump
directly to the tag. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: Two new commands: cmeGPushCursorPos and cmeGPopCursorPos. They are
"global push/pop cursor pos". So they also remmember the file. They help to
implement a "tag stack". From what Thiago suggested.<br>
<li> Added: Before jumping to a tag the editor does a cmeGPushCursorPos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.544  2004/07/21 19:59:04  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When deleting a breakpoint the editor could hang if the breakpoint
couldn't be found.<br>
<li> Added: Now if the program to debug (the copy with debug info) is in a
directory other than the current one this directory becomes the reference
for filenames. It allowed me to debug SETEdit from SETEdit and using the
setedit.epr file which is in "../" from the point of view of the binary.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.543  2004/07/20 20:45:00  set<br>
<li> Added: Now we can attach to running processes. Nice, but it expossed more
gdb bugs :-(<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.542  2004/07/20 19:33:17  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Added dummies to allow compilation when libmigdb isn't installed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.541  2004/07/20 16:27:09  set<br>
<li> Added: The first part of the code to support debugging using libmigdb.<br>
<li> Synchronized some CVS details with my home CVS.<br>
<li> Version 0.5.4 (Glaciar P.Moreno I)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.540  2004/07/19 20:02:00  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Debian] Applied patch S.F. #993014 submitted by Baurjan Ismagulov
(ibr): "Add an include file required by rhide".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.539  2004/07/19 19:53:20  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [config] --cxx-flags flag was reported as --cpp-flags in the help.
Now both are valid. Reported by Ullal Devappa Kini (wmbfqj/vsnl/net).<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] Cygwin can execute the "make install" target, but it
installed binaries without .exe extension. That's quite annoying for Win32.
I added a "--keep-extension" option to avoid it, isn't tested. Reported by
Ullal Devappa Kini (wmbfqj/vsnl/net).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.538  2004/06/29 14:27:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] The char */*name*/ sequence confused the compiler. Reported
by Arnold.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.537  2004/06/28 17:57:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Corrupted MP3 files could produce a crash. It closes SF Bug
#932091 reported by silverdirk, he sent me a file to reproduce the problem.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.536  2004/06/28 17:56:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The menu files uses nested preprocessor directives but it wasn't
supported.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.535  2004/06/28 17:56:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [BC++] 5.5 can't really remove unreachable code. That's another
evidence of the poor quality of Borland compilers in terms of optimization.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.534  2004/06/28 17:55:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing CleanUpHolidays() for targets that doesn't support dlopen.
Additionaly I modified the code to use if (xxxx) instead of plain
preprocessor.<br>
<li> Fixed: [djgpp] Problems in calcu.cc because of unconditional definition
of NULL in locale.h.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.533  2004/06/25 19:46:21  set<br>
<li> Fixed: SUP_PCRE could be redefined :-(, added protection.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.532  2004/06/25 18:28:08  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] A new command called "prex" to perform Perl regular
expressions searches. It is documented and I also added an example to
macros.slp, it calls wc and shows the results in the status line.<br>
<li> Modified: The SUP_PCRE macro to be 0 or 1 instead of un/defined. This
could generate compilation problems for platforms where PCRE isn't
supported, but the code is more clear now.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.531  2004/06/23 20:10:00  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Assignment of Boolean from int.<br>
<li> Fixed: Use of bool type (instead of int or Boolean).<br>
<li> Modified: "new" header inclusion to be selected by compatlayer.
All from Arnold Wiegert information.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.530  2004/06/23 19:33:21  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MSVC] Use of /Tp<file> instead of /TP in makefiles. It looks
like MSVC 4.0 only supports it. Reported by by Arnold Wiegert.<br>
<li> Fixed: Leaks in TCEditWindow (intl stuff), List of windows and
loadnobkp.cc. valgrind.<br>
<li> Fixed: "New" buffers shouldn't be added to the list of closed windows
when closed. It generated a read out of bounds and a write of unitialized
data to disk. valgrind.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.529  2004/06/22 20:34:12  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] References to make in the nmake files. Report and solution
by Arnold Wiegert.<br>
<li> Modified: [Makefiles] extrimk to generate the first dependency with
relative path. I should allow .umk files to be used without the need of
"vpath" or ".path" directives. That's because nmake lacks both directives.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.528  2004/06/22 16:30:43  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] More macros from Thiago. They are short and quite
interesting because they show how to add particular behaviors or
funtionalities with small code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.527  2004/06/22 16:01:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Cosmetic] Added a ; after the ListBoxImplement(..) macros. They
looks more "correct" and doesn't confuse my heuristic to search fro
functions ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.526  2004/06/22 15:11:58  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] Experimental!!! now you can use cme* commands for
SendCommands. They are propperly sent to the application instead of the
current editor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.525  2004/06/18 14:21:19  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some details in the heuristic C++ functions searcher. They address
problems with the const and throw() attributes.<br>
<li> Modified: The program that extracts dependencies from the RHIDE's .mak
files to avoid putting the creation date (I don't remmember why I needed it
and it generates extra CVS traffic) and to sort dependencies (also reduces
CVS traffic).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.524  2004/06/17 16:50:32  set<br>
<li> Added: Missing desktop examples. Reported as bug #974095 @ SF by Ognyan
Kulev (ogi).<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.519  2004/06/09 15:40:42  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed from CVS various files that are generated by configure
script. They are included in distribution but people using CVS must run
the configure script.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.518  2004/06/09 15:08:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: internac/gnumake.in didn't define CXX and instead replaced the
two points where it was used. Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Added: libbzip2, libpcre and libz. Now have configurable makefiles.<br>

<li> Fixed: Another strchr call.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.514  2004/06/04 13:27:22  set<br>
<li> Added: A small script to meassure the number of lines of code. Currently
over than 108,000. It skips third party libs.<br>
<li> Fixed: strstr and strchr are declared different in C++ standard. BC++
does it (not gcc 2.95.4) and it generated compilation errors when using
BC++. Reported by Arnold Wiegert.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.513  2004/06/02 19:57:43  set<br>
<li> Added: [SHL] vbe and vst as VHDL extensions. Used by Alliance for "Vhdl

<li> Modified: [Debian] Applied patch #962884 S.F. submitted by Baurjan
Ismagulov - ibr. Related to the libset package. It needs some adjustments.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.511  2004/05/31 13:44:16  set<br>
<li> Added: OS/OS flavor,CPU,Compiler/Compiler flavor and Driver to the about
box. Suggested by Arnold Wiegert (awiegert/telus/net)<br>
<li> Added: C,H and CPP as valid C extensions for syntax highlight. C is the
C++ extension for gcc and the others are for non-casesensitive OSs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.510  2004/05/24 14:38:27  set<br>
<li> Modified: [config] Use of "g++" in favor of "gcc -lstdc++". This is
because newer gcc 3.x compilers can't compile C++ code without doing a
mess when we use the gcc frontend. From a report by Baurjan Ismagulov - ibr<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.509  2004/05/24 13:40:41  set<br>
<li> Added: Applied patch #959018 Add libset-dev Debian package. Submitted by

<b>Revision</b> 1.508  2004/05/21 16:16:19  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The heuristic C/C++ parser to support list of exceptions
(function throw(...) {body}).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.507  2004/05/17 14:06:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing va_end and abuse of va_list type. It looks like the newer
PPC's glibc implements things in a way that va_list variables can't be
assigned to other va_list variables. Reported by MDaniel.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.506  2004/05/12 14:21:25  set<br>

valgrind.<br>
<li> Added: Avoid a no-op copy reported by Oswald.<br>
<li> Fixed: Use of unitialized undo counter in some rectangular selection
operations. Reported by valgrind.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.504  2004/05/06 19:33:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some malloc/new/new[] v.s. free/delete/delete[] calls. Reported
by Oswald using valgrind.<br>
<li> Fixed: memcpy shouldn't be used if blocks overlaps, no matters the
copying direction. That's a portability issue. Reported by Oswald using
valgrind.<br>
<li> Fixed: Undo count for the first undo wasn't initialized. Very dangerous.
Reported by Oswald using valgrind.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some drawing variables not initialized. Could make the row/col
cursor appear until a new redraw. Reported by Oswald using valgrind.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.503  2004/05/05 19:09:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When copying something from the calculator and the paste wasn't
enabled before entering the calculator then you needed to at least move the
cursor before you could paste. Now the Paste status is updated without
needing any extra action.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.502  2004/04/22 19:09:28  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.487  2003/12/15 21:21:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [RPM] The prereq seems to be /sbin/install-info and not
/usr/bin/... At least that's what most specs found by Google shows ;-)
I also added install and delete for the info files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.486  2003/12/15 14:59:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When pasting using the OS clipboard and the cursor was moved to
the end of the selection it could go out of screen which is quite annoying.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.485  2003/12/15 14:58:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A couple of details about the last option and when is greyed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.484  2003/12/15 14:56:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some int v.s. unsigned details related to the last patch.<br>
<li> Modified: cmcSaveAsUNIX and cmcSaveAsDOS commands to be
cmcSaveAsConvertEOL which is more clear.<br>
<li> Added: A new command cmcSaveAsNoConvertEOL used to avoid automatic
conversions when they are enabled. From a suggestion by Oswald.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.483  2003/12/11 19:54:37  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Compilation problems with gcc 3.x. Patch from Oswald:
  - Missing \n at end of palbcc.h
  - Missing explicit parent constructor call in mp3/ampdiag.cc
  - Constant out of range in include/ced_exte.h (I also modified
    edconst.cc accordingly)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.482  2003/12/09 19:24:32  set<br>
<li> Modified: The 'Compile' macro example. It was contributed by Thiago and
now he added an example on how to choose the compiler according to the
syntax.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.481  2003/12/09 18:28:08  set<br>
<li> Added: Errors parser for Perl. Contributed by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.480  2003/12/09 16:48:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When aborting an overwrite (in save as) the name of the window
was changed anyway :-P<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.479  2003/12/09 16:09:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The new code needed a conditional to avoid ridiculous small sizes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.478  2003/12/09 16:07:51  set<br>
<li> Added: "File open" dialogs remmembers its size and position. Each kind of
dialog have its own values, so open and save as are independent. I know it
could confuse some people but it allows better customization. From a
suggestion by gradha.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.477  2003/12/09 16:06:30  set<br>

<li> Added: Some rudimentary $(VARIABLE) expansion to the "File under cursor"
files list. Suggested by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: To also search in the same directory where a file is located when
using the "File under cursor" stuff. Suggested by Grzegorz.<p>

<li> Added: AltKeysSetting TV config keyword.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.471  2003/11/24 15:44:19  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some gcc versions needs explicit use of libstdc++ to link C++ and

<b>Revision</b> 1.470  2003/11/18 14:30:19  set<br>
<li> Added: More cases to the code that detects "Emacs comments" at the end of
the file. From information provided by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.469  2003/11/17 16:10:39  set<br>
<li> Added: Now if you don't specify any path to "search files under cursor"
the editor tries to automagically fills this list using the output of cpp.
From a suggestion by Oswald.<br>
<li> Added: If the Ctrl+Enter fails to find the file under cursor now that's
informed in the "status line" of the current editor. Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Added: If the editor fails to find the file under cursor now it also
looks for it in the project. From a suggestion by Oswald.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.468  2003/11/17 16:09:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When starting a project using a different window size the project

Suggested by Oswald.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.466  2003/11/12 15:03:36  set<br>
<li> Added: More "intelligence" behind the "Paste Emacs Mode", now it only
takes as valid entries that defines the "mode" variable.<br>
<li> Modified: The position of "Emacs mode" insertion is now the same of a
previous definition. Both things comes from a talk with Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.465  2003/11/12 14:07:01  set<br>
<li> Added: Looks like the "Emacs Mode" comments can appear more than once in
the same file defining different variables. Now when the editor looks for
it doesn't stop in the first match. Note that it doesn't affect the
behavior on the "Paste Emacs Mode" which only searchs for the first
occurrence. From a report by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.464  2003/11/05 18:51:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed: I forgot that global options also mentioned "purge spaces".
Pointed out by Oswald.<p>

<li> Fixed: When searching outside comments and the match was found in the
first column of a line after a comment it was ignored. Reported by Alain.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.458  2003/10/20 15:33:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: While locking the editor in the S&R y did it wrong and the S&R
confirmation didn't move to the correct coordinate.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.457  2003/10/20 15:32:12  set<br>
<li> Added: Now sLisp can replace things like ^K key binding even when it
implies removing all the ^K-x assignments. It allows a complete
replacement.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.456  2003/10/20 15:31:16  set<br>
<li> Modified: "Do not purge spaces" option to be "Keep trailing whitespace"
that's more descriptive. Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Fixed: No match pair after deleting some text and the cursor goes to a
symbol. Reported by Oswald.<br>
<li> Modified: To lock the screen while doing a search & replace operation to
avoid "flashing" when doing a lot of S&R operations. Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Fixed: Wrong match pair when the cursor was in the middle of a tab and
the next character matched a pair (highlight in the middle of the tab).
Reported by Oswald.<br>
<li> Fixed: Undo error when a character replaced a tab (overwrite enabled) and
the cursor was inside the tab (not at the beggining). Reported by Oswald.<br>
<li> Added: History to the "arbitrary indent" and "run command" input lines.
Suggested by Oswald.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.455  2003/10/16 20:02:35  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Cygwin] Collision between strndup and calculator parser.
Personally don't know mush about this issue but looks like a name space
pollution in Cygwin.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.454  2003/10/16 19:42:47  set<br>
<li> Modified: To select the closest word when using double click and not the
next. Suggested by Alain.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.453  2003/10/16 19:41:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A code page problem. A little bit complex to describe: If you
started the editor for the first time in a Linux console and forced the
encoding to "Latin 1u" (improperly configured system IMHO). Then you
acessed remotly to this system using XTerm you got a messed code page and
no way to fix it. This is because the editor tried to use Linux console
settings but as XTerm can't change its code page you have no way to disable
the "forced" check box for the screen code page. Now the editor avoids it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.452  2003/10/16 19:40:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The "Jump" button in the main window of the class browser produced
SIGSEGVs. I went too far reusing code ;-). Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.451  2003/10/16 19:39:10  set<br>
<li> Added: Some clarification in the docs about the meaning of the maximum
number of R.O. copies.<br>
<li> Added: Now when the message window (and other sources) request to open
a file that is part of the project it is opened using the relative path
and not an absolute path. It annoyed me for a long time and Oswald insisted
on it ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.450  2003/10/16 19:38:02  set<br>
<li> Added: Project windows are "closed" (hided) when pressing ESC. Suggested
by Oswald Budden.<br>
<li> Added: When opening new windows usually the editor checks if a project is
opened, in this case windows aren't zoomed. Now if the project window isn't
visible they are also zoomed, after all they weren't zoomed to avoid
hidding the project window. Suggested by Oswald Budden.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.449  2003/10/16 19:35:20  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] KeyBindings and BindKey commands. With them you can change
key bindings from sLisp.<br>
<li> Fixed: Errors in the conditionals parser for menu files.<br>
<li> Added: More variables to check in menu files: MP3, PCRE, BZIP2, MIXER and
UNIX. Suggested by Oswald.<br>
<li> Added: A new chapter to the docs: Documentation guide. It can be used to
find other chapters and sections according to the topic they are related
to.<br>
<li> Added: A new chapter to the docs: Menues configuration.<br>
<li> Added: A new section to the docs: Configuration files location.<br>
<li> Added: Now the index of the documentation also includes all the chapters,
sections, etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.448  2003/10/16 19:34:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When the alternative sorting mode of the project window was
enabled some internal searches failed because they expected the old sorting
mode. Now the sorting mode is temporally changed.<br>
<li> Fixed: When switching between sorting modes the focused item changed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.447  2003/10/16 19:12:45  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Configuration] TV 2.0.3 dependency because I'm currently using
a couple of additions to the API and hence users needs CVS version.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] SelectWindowNumber used to change the focused window. when
used for an edition window it also changes the sLisp target allowing to
modify another buffer, not just the one selected when the macro was
triggered.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] GetCurWindowNumber and GetMaxWindowNumber they can be used
to apply an operation to all the windows and also to go back to the
original window.<br>
<li> Modified: The Alt+window_number combination now belongs to the menues and
isn't hardcoded in TV anymore.<br>
<li> Added: Commands to select the project and message windows, also to select
the first 19 editors. With the help of sLisp and last aditions now is
possible to select any window using just a key or menu entry.<br>
<li> Modified: To avoid status messages when running sLisp code binded to a
key or menu entry.<br>
<li> Added: Documented and translated to spanish.<br>
<li> Version 0.5.3 (Iguazu II)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.446  2003/10/16 19:03:29  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] now you can bind a small piece of sLisp code to a key or
a menu entry. With it the user doesn't need to edit macros.slp for small
stuff. It will also allow passing arguments when macros support it. I
implemented it to solve a limitation pointed out by Alain.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.445  2003/10/14 15:51:26  set<br>
<li> Added: In the project window now you can choose between a way to display
files that's easier to find by name and another suitable to find them by
their directory. From suggestions by Sam Thursfield <samth@mail.ru> and
Alain <alainm@pobox.com>, but I think others also asked for it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.444  2003/10/14 15:39:27  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] FindString, FindAgain, ReplaceString and ReplaceAgain sLisp
commands. Based on code an ideas by Bernd.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.438  2003/08/15 18:51:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Configuration] The configure script didn't take the CXXFLAGS
variable, instead always used rhtv-config output (only CXXFLAGS, no CFLAGS)
I discovered it when Ivan starter to wonder why debian/rules wasn't able to
change the compilation options ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.437  2003/08/13 18:38:07  set<br>
<li> Added: A link to the "pure DOS" fix/test release to the web page and also
made the more visible the link to S.F. summary page.<p>

<li> Fixed: If no tags files are present and you want to add one to the list
now the editor doesn't suggest reading the docs.<br>
<li> Added: Support for the tags files generated by objdump (this is my small
contribution to GNU binutils project ;-). In these files I use some new
"keys" not defined by ctags. It also contains prototypes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.433  2003/07/22 19:18:50  set<br>
<li> More small adjustments for the final release. Web page and docs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.432  2003/07/22 14:52:22  set<br>

"Release Candidate" stage.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.431  2003/07/16 13:33:37  set<br>
<li> Modified: The RPM scripts to support an environment variable to indicate
where to create the RPMs. I needed it when using S.F. Compiler Farm and
Red Hat 7.3 which always failed when using a directory mounted with NFS.<br>
<li> Modified: The source package creation to create the "result" directory
if it doesn't exist.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.430  2003/07/14 17:54:07  set<br>
<li> Added: More SQL keywords. Contributed by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.429  2003/07/10 20:22:17  set<br>

and revision.<br>
<li> Added: Link to TAGs tutorial in the docs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.424  2003/06/30 13:09:15  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [BC++] a bug in the EasyDiag label and radio buttons that made
Alt+L and similars to generate GPFs. This is very interesting: the GPF was
generated by code that I forgot to remove while adapting to the new i18n
mechanism. The code was useless and hence gcc simply removed it (2.81 to
3.3 versions tested) but BC++ 5.5/5.6 seems to be quite inferior optimizing
and didn't remove the code. This code walked a single chained list but
using wrong pointers (NULL or released).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.423  2003/06/30 13:08:17  set<br>
<li> Added: [Config] makes directory to the library search path. It makes
RHIDE projects easier.<br>
<li> Added: [Config] --libset to my DOS default config. I finally managed to
compile RHIDE 1.5 CVS for DOS. It took me a day to figure out the problems
in my system and workaround gdb make problems.<br>
<li> Added: [Config] less to the DOS cvs update batch.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.422  2003/06/30 13:07:09  set<br>
<li> Added: A script to update from CVS using the options I use. A DOS batch
file and a shell script are provided.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.421  2003/06/27 19:52:07  set<br>
<li> Added: Some SQL keywords. Contributed by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.420  2003/06/24 19:17:47  set<br>
<li> Added: A tutorial explaining how to use tags stuff step by step. It have
graphics but I'm not sure about distributing them, size issue.<br>
<li> Fixed: Fails in the "Export as HTML" command when some text was selected.<br>
<li> Fixed: When using completion words and the word to complete made match
with the last symbols the editor crashed.<br>

more accurate description about keyboard under X11.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.416  2003/06/23 14:27:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] the code to paste the current selection to the secondary
OS clipboard wrongly computed the condition to determine if the selection
was valid or not. As a result it tried to paste a negative line. The
consequence ranged from nothing to an infinite loop, including SIGSEGVs and
wrong text in the window. It was exposed by some double click conditions
but also with simple clicks.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.415  2003/06/23 14:21:10  set<br>
<li>** New name for release: Iguazu I ***<br>
<li> Added: now the releases will have names to identify them easier.<br>
<li> Added: revision number to the about dialogs, suggested by Ivan. The
number will be based on my local CVS revision number. The S.F. offset could
need adjustments. The revision number is only updated when compiling with
the maintainer mode enabled.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.414  2003/06/18 19:55:12  set<br>
<li> Added: Now ManView window can be closed with ESC. Suggested by Thiago.<br>

<li> Added: cmcCommentIndent/cmcCommentUnIndent now indents the current line
if nothing is selected. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] a command to find which syntax highlight is in use. From an
idea suggested by Thiago.<p>

<li> Added: [Linux] an script to create TV and SETEdit RPMs in one call.<br>
<li> Added: Documentation about compilation and installation for BC++, Linux
and generic UNIX systems. Also explanation for the .deb files. I also
removed the obsolete information found in the README that now points to

<li> Added: A script to generate the RPMs in an easy way.<br>
<li> Modified: RPMs release version to 1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.406  2003/06/13 20:55:22  set<br>
<li> Added: Files and instructions to create RPMs. They are bbcat's .spec
files with some additions and corrections. Things I'm not sure they will
remain:
1) Need of tar.bz2 file.
2) Use of package-version dir.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.405  2003/06/13 12:22:11  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] (repeat times commands...) from code and ideas contributed
by Bernd.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] (= var value) as an alias for (setv ...<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] (++ "var_name") and (-- "var_name"), they behaves as their
C counterparts.<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for all of them.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.404  2003/06/12 21:10:05  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option to avoid redirecting stdout when running an external
program. Useful for interactive applications that uses stdout. Documented.
Translated to spanish.<br>
<li> Fixed: [UNIX] When running an external program and using the "OS screen"
the editor made a complete mess because the routine redirected stdout and
then suspended. It made the UNIX/Linux console drivers to try to use the
file as a console 8-P<br>
<li> Fixed: [sLisp] The RunProgram command was affected by the options in the
configuration dialog. Now they are independent.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] Two constants to be used by RunProgram. They are for the
old option (use OS/user screen) and the new option to avoid redirecting
stdout.<br>
<li> Added: The new sLisp commands and all the constants to syntaxhl.shl.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.403  2003/06/12 21:07:53  set<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] GetCursorX, GetCursorY and SetCursorXY commands.
Documented.<br>
<li> Added: A new command that inserts a new line without moving the cursor
nor indenting. This is the old WordStar ^N command. Replaced the old ^N
assignment. Added to menues. Translated to spanish.<br>
<li> Fixed: JumpLastCursorPos was interpreted as command 154 instead of 153
when used from menues.<br>
<li> Fixed: + and - should change month in calendar, but used a very all (and
nasty) legacy mechanism.<br>
<li> Added: Calendar windows can be closed pressing ESC.<p>

<li> Added: [sLisp] loop and exitloop sentences, also ==, !=, ++ and --<br>operators. All of them have some basic behavior that could be extended but
is enough for a <2.5 hours hack ;-) I added some documentation and a small
example. I implemented to show to Bernd Becker how to implement loop
sentence.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.400  2003/06/05 20:12:29  set<br>

1) I don't understand why, I think it should be enforced only if the
sequence is ambiguous, after all compilers are supposed to help people.
2) I don't understand why, is so easy to support.
3) I don't understand why it can be promoted to int as in any other place.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.397  2003/06/04 20:45:13  set<br>
<li> Added: A new command called cmcJumpLastCursorPos. It works similar to
cmcLastPosCur but uses a different mechanism. I assigned this command to
^Q-P that according to Alain <alainm@pobox.com> is the WordStar command for
it. Looking for feedback.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.396  2003/06/04 17:36:39  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for makeinfo 4.4 and newer. For some reason the new
versions doesn't support _ inside names (only -). Really uncompatible from
my point of view. Lamentably this is currently shipped in a few rare Linux
distributions like Slackware 9.0.0 and SuSE 8.2 (no in previous releases,
nor in any Debian nor Red Hat nor Mandrake distro). And Andris and Michel
didn't sent me the intermediate file needed to find the problem.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.395  2003/06/02 15:12:20  set<br>
<li> Modified: Configuration script to adapt to the new TV directory
structure. Now the resulting lib is in ../tvision/makes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.394  2003/05/30 19:51:37  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Config: Moved TV detection to be before detecting CFLAGS so we can
be sure be can get TV settings.<br>
<li> Added: Config: Advices when using shipped libs.<br>
<li> Fixed: Config: AA lib detection when running the configure script in a
remote console.<br>
<li> Removed: [Debian] recode as dependency.<br>
<li> Removed: [Debian] .mak files from "files to back-up".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.393  2003/05/26 14:30:58  set<br>
<li> Modified: Makefile.nmk to be a wrapper for Makefile.bcc by just including
it. The only difference is that it defines FOR_NMAKE=1 and this will force
to use definitions for MSVC compiler.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.392  2003/05/26 14:07:48  set<br>
<li> Modified: The mkf, imk and umk files to allow more abstraction regrading
to file extensions. So now objects can be .o or .obj or anything.<br>
<li> Added: Makefiles to use the umk files with BC++. I successfully compiled
the editor and infview using the .umk files called from a main Makefile.bcc
I keep the old mechanism until this is more tested.<br>
<li> Added: Files for nmake, but they aren't tested and I'm quite sure they
will need adjusts. I need a volunteer.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.391  2003/05/26 14:03:14  set<br>
<li> Modified: The makefiles to maintain the .imk and .umk files only when
the "Maintainer Mode" is enabled.<br>
<li> Added: --no-prefix-h to configset because I use /usr as prefix and this
is already in the list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.390  2003/05/23 20:19:45  set<br>
<li> Modified: Sorted the configure options by category so people can find the
needed option faster.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.389  2003/05/23 19:19:47  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now if you configure the editor without special options the
makfiles avoids header dependencies. Using --enable-maintainer-mode enables
the complex dependencies.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.388  2003/05/23 16:10:32  set<br>
<li> Added: Detection and use of rhtv-config even if it isn't installed.<br>
<li> Added: Error message if rhtv-config can't be found.<br>
<li> Removed: X11 headers stuff from configuration header. The editor doesn't
really use it, is all abstracted by TV.<br>
<li> Added: Rules so make detects the configuration scripts are newer and
forces the user to reconfigure.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.387  2003/05/23 13:23:52  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Details about the new configuration.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.386  2003/05/23 13:20:05  set<br>
<li> Modified: Some details about the configuration process. Now the scripts
takes C flags, C++ flags, libraries and path to libraries from TV
configuration using rhtv-config tool. I'm testing it so please be patient.
Sorry for inconvenients.<p><br>--- CVS tag i0_5_2b ---<br>--- Tarball uploaded to S.F. ---<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.385  2003/05/22 20:47:31  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for "DOS files" to the .mak parser. Just in case.<br>
<li> Updated: .imk files to avoid the need of gpr2mak.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.384  2003/05/22 19:24:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: It was wrong again ;-), if the source was newer than imks and the
.exe didn't exist it failed. Thanks Kevin for the patience.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.383  2003/05/21 21:13:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Wrong dependencies for genimk and extrimk again! Hope this time
they are ok. Reported by Kevin.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.382  2003/05/21 20:34:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A lot of pointer casts to compile for 64 bits processors. The code
compiles for Itanium but isn't stable.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.381  2003/05/20 19:02:32  set<br>
<li> Modified: Some details of the powered grep to make it more friendly:
1) During a blocking call to grep the "busy indicator" is enabled.
2) During a recursive search you can stop the recursivity pressing ^C.
3) Gives a change to update the screen after each run, very important for
the X11 driver.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.380  2003/05/20 17:29:24  set<br>
<li> Added: Emacs modes for CSS files. From Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.379  2003/05/20 14:12:42  set<br>
<li> Added: A new couple of commands to copy and paste to/from the OS
clipboard when using the TInputLinePiped input boxes. These commands must
be used in menu files if you want to use the OS clipboard for it. They are
called cmtilCopyOS and cmtilPasteOS. From a request by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.378  2003/05/19 21:03:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When importing items to the project the editor:
1) Didn't redraw the project window.
2) Didn't use the base path for the project.
From a report by Kevin.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.377  2003/05/19 14:18:16  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MinGW] Looks like pwd can be called from Perl, at least from
the Perl I have. Most probably the problem is that MinGW have pwd only as
an internal shell command.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] Collision between Win32 API and GetLastError from holidays
module.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.376  2003/05/19 14:12:56  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MinGW] Looks like pwd can be called from Perl, at least from
the Perl I have. Most probably the problem is that MinGW have pwd only as
an internal shell command.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] Collision between Win32 API and GetLastError from holidays
module.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.375  2003/05/19 14:11:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The confignt.pl script not collected all the object files needed
for BC++ and MSVC.<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing -I..\holidays for BC++ and MSVC.<br>
<li> Modified: Disabled "Unreachable code" BC++ warning. The compiler
generates it for code that was obviously coded to achieve it (if (0) ....).<br>
<li> Fixed: I can't beleive I left a ; at the end of a while in the code fixed
by revision 1.830 (home CVS number). Detected by BC++.<br>
<li> Fixed: Assigment to Boolean from a boolean condition. Detected by BC++.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.374  2003/05/19 14:09:57  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The install.mkf needed settvuti path and also the addition of
libwin.<br>
<li> Fixed: The distribution contained common.imk twice.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.373  2003/05/16 20:59:40  set<br>
<li> Added: Some text about RHIDE to the web page and a link to a patch that
allows creating an RHIDE compiled with the current CVS code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.372  2003/05/16 19:25:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: clean target of holidays directory didn't ignore errors.<br>
<li> Fixed: extra \n at the end of distribution lists produced problems.<br>
<li> Fixed: missing .mkf files in distro.<br>
<li> Note: compiled (not tested) for Mandrake 9.1 and Red Hat 9.0. Compiled
and tested for Solaris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.371  2003/05/16 15:30:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Wrong dependencies for the .imk files. They depends on the imk
generator, but the source, not the exe. The exe will be always newer than
the imk files for fresh check outs and it forced to have gpr2mak. Seen on
Solaris where I don't have grp2mak.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.370  2003/05/16 12:53:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing C++ lib for extrimk.cc and genimk.cc. Reported by Kevin
Alm <kevinalm@shenessex.heartland.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.369  2003/05/16 12:41:30  set<br>
<li> Modified: To ever include stdc++ as library in the worst case it will be
listed twice.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.368  2003/05/15 18:10:26  set<br>
<li> Modified: configset to wait for ENTER instead of sleeping 2 seconds. As
suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.367  2003/05/15 18:04:42  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The tool to transport patches from my home to SF CVS skipped some
patches :-( I think it was the source for various misterious missing
patches. I hope the new version really solves the problem.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.366  2003/05/14 19:54:09  set<br>
<li> Added: A check for makeinfo 4.5. It doesn't work and generates
compilation problems. So now if that's detected the configuration assumes
makeinfo isn't usable.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.365  2003/05/14 16:23:19  set<br>
<li> Modified: Moved the libset target to makes/Makefile so it is cleaner and
includes the "makes" dependency.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.364  2003/05/14 16:01:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: For some reason S.F. CVS had a configure script that didn't use
libset.mkf (used the .mak).<br>
<li> Fixed: The code to extract BC++ and MSVC objects failed with the new .imk
format of 1 dependency by line.<br>
<li> Added: RHIDE 1.5 CVS defines vpath for includes as all the include
directories and then stripts these directories from dependencies. This is
different to what previous versions used. Now the imks generator supports
it.<br>
<li> Added: RHIDE 1.5 CVS generates some absolute path dependencies, I'm not
sure if it only happends for old .gpr files. Now the .imk generator tries
to convert them into relative and scan again looking for the proper include
directory before giving up.<br>
<li> Fixed: The -m option was disabled during the TV 1.x to 2.x process, now
is enabled again using TV 2.x mechanisms.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.363  2003/05/13 14:58:18  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some details needed to compile RHIDE 1.5, CVS snapshot for today.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.362  2003/05/13 12:51:18  set<br>
<li> Fixed: More documentation details. Patch from Bernd.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.361  2003/05/12 19:31:18  set<br>
<li> Modified: Made the "Paste Emacs mode" more robust. If the first line is
"#!..." the comment is pasted in the second. If the mode was already
pasted by the editor it is first deleted. Suggested by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.360  2003/05/12 15:55:23  set<br>
<li> Modified: Made more robust the "shell script" shl detection/ It now
supports: "#!.../env command" => command and "#!.../commandVERSION" =>
command (example python2.2 => python). From Grzegorz suggestions.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.359  2003/05/12 15:23:33  set<br>
<li> Modified: The imk generator to generate one dependency in each line. This
makes files bigger (5.5 % for editor.imk) but reduces the CVS traffic
because when a dependency is added only one line is affected and no all the
lines after it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.358  2003/05/12 14:39:33  set<br>
<li> Added: Emacs modes and shell names for Tcl and Python. Suggested by
Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.357  2003/05/12 13:45:50  set<br>
<li> Added: A dialog to dis/enable any advice dialog (also the Quit + delete
warning).<br>
<li> Modified: Now when you "Quit" (cmeQuitDelete) and the warning dialog pops
up you can press Escape to abort the process. Suggested by Alex Lozano.<br>
<li> Added: Virtual members to TStringable to un/mark items. I used it for the
new dialog.<br>
<li> Added: Un/mark facilities to TStringableListBox for TStringables that
reports support for it.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<br>
<li> Documented: "Check for modified files" and "Advice dialogs" configuration
options. Both linked to contexts.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.356  2003/05/12 13:44:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Also infview.mkf needed FOR_EDITOR as extra flags and libset.mkf
needed FOR_LIBSET.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.355  2003/05/12 13:43:36  set<br>
<li> Added: A dialog to configure if the editor will check modification times
after running an external program and/or periodically. Also how many seconds
to wait between checks. Saved to desktop file.<br>
<li> Fixed: When no project is available now the "Powered Grep" avoids using
"search in projects" as default.<br>
<li> Fixed: I forgot the C_EXTRA_FLAGS in editor.mkf.<br>
<li> Fixed: The above mentioned error also existed for BC++ and MSVC producing
wrong InfView colors.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<br>
<li> Version 0.5.2<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.354  2003/05/12 13:41:34  set<br>
<li> Added: Every 8 seconds and from the idle loop the editor checks if we
are editing a file and in this case if the modification time of the file
on disk changed.<br>
<li> Added: Every time we focuse an editor the idle loop checks the
modification time of the copy on disk.<br>
<li> Added: When the editor detects the copy on disk is newer and that we also
modified the copy in memory the editor asks for 4 options:
1) Load the file from disk, it discards changes in the copy we have on
memory.
2) Don't do anything, the user must solve the problem.
3) Like 1 but the editor invokes diff -u and shows the output.
4) Like 2 but with diff like in 3.<br>
<li> Added: If GNU diff isn't isntalled we show an advice dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.353  2003/05/12 13:40:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Deatails about handling RHIDE 1.4.7 and 1.5 projects.<br>
<li> Fixed: Difference between the criteria of return values between exit,
djgpp, glibc and make.<br>
<li> Fixed: sdgcline compilation issues.<br>
<li> Added: Avoid to generate new rhide.env files if they won't change. Now
they are dependencies.<br>
<li> Added: Support for the new .imk files to the BC++ and MSVC configuration
process (confignt.pl).<br>
<li> Fixed: ../holidays shouldn't be in SUPPORT_INC.<br>
<li> Modified: To avoid dependencies from $(TVISION_INC)/cl<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.352  2003/05/12 13:37:59  set<br>
<li> Added: A new system for the makefiles. Expect all kind of compilation
problems. It will simplify the configuration process and reduce CVS patches
to .mak files.<br>
<li> Fixed: libamp case sensitive include.<br>
<li> Fixed: sdgcline details to allow clean compilation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.351  2003/05/09 13:09:03  set<br>
<li> Added: A check to determine if the configure script is newer than the
cache. If that's the case the cache is discarded.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.350  2003/05/08 18:03:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: After loading a file from a desktop file with column cursor
enabled it wasn't visible until the cursor was moved.<br>
<li> Added: A bizarre desktop example with two fonts.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.349  2003/05/08 18:00:46  set<br>
<li> Added: Context sensitive help for the holidays configuration.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.348  2003/05/07 19:53:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor forces Tab==\t.<br>
<li> Modified: The word completion key to be Ctrl+Tab as suggested by Grzegorz
I'll give a try to this combination.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.347  2003/05/07 19:44:21  set<br>
<li> Fixed: EasyDiag meassured the width of the dialog's title using the
untranslated string.<br>
<li> Modified: The dialog to wait for a key during in the keyboard
configuration to use EasyDiag.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.346  2003/05/07 15:01:20  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation for the fixed messages. Also committing a
fresh german file that needs fixes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.345  2003/05/07 14:26:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Applied a batch of patches from Bernd to fix messages in the code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.344  2003/05/07 12:41:15  set<br>
<li> Added: holidays.cc to the project and makefiles. That's a whole update
of the makefiles, please reconfigure the package if you are using CVS.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.343  2003/05/07 12:34:42  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The holidays directory must be used for includes even when
dynamic libs are not supported.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.342  2003/05/07 12:33:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Some people to the list of contributors to the docs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.341  2003/05/07 12:33:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Second lot of changes to docs from Bernd Becker
<munin@munin.inka.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.340  2003/05/06 20:45:13  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Tags: Some languages (the ones after PHP) had errors in the kind
decoding.<br>
<li> Added: HTML language and kind:a to the list of supported tags, Grzegorz
have a modified E.Ctags that supports it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.339  2003/05/06 20:26:04  set<br>
<li> Added: A dialog to force a plug-in for the calendar. Useful if the user
doesn't define the LANG environment variable or if that isn't enough to
determine the country.<br>
<li> Modified: Moved most of holidays plug-in code to a separated file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.338  2003/05/06 12:34:04  set<br>
<li> Added: a small doc explaining how to write a "holidays plug-in".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.337  2003/05/06 12:32:41  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A lot of typos and errors in docs. <b>Revision</b> by Bernd Becker
<munin@munin.inka.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.336  2003/05/06 12:31:49  set<br>
<li> Added: Conditional to compute statistics about the tags. Reports really
interesting info.<br>
<li> Modified: The way that Tags are displayed in lists to make them more
readable as suggested by Grzegorz. I used the stats to determine the sizes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.335  2003/05/05 20:40:31  set<br>
<li> Added: A configuration file for the "holiday plug-ins", it maps a value
of the LANG environment variable to a country and .so.<br>
<li> Added: A default plug-in with the most common holidays more or less used
world-wide.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.334  2003/05/05 14:34:35  set<br>
<li> Added: yield to Python keywords (introduced in 2.2). Contributed by
Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.333  2003/05/05 14:08:41  set<br>
<li> Added: The first step towards support for plug-ins to highlight holidays
in the calendar. Currently is only supported for systems implementing
dlopen() and I have a plug-in only for my country ;-). I'll soon make it
selectable and write a mini-doc about how to write those plug-ins.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.332  2003/05/05 14:06:06  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the dialog that shows the list of classes isn't case
sensitive. That's why I feel that's much more intuitive and easier to use.<br>
<li> Fixed: When searching in classes without a perfect match of the word
under cursor and jumping to a member the editor jumped but offered the list
of classes again.<br>
<li> Fixed: The list of "functions" supports things that aren't strcitly
programming languages, like texinfo sources, for this reason the "space"
key should't act as item selector (can be part of the name in an
incremental search).<br>
<li> Fixed: When switching from a window with some syntax highlight to another
with a different shl and using Alt+F2 it was common to get a wrong result
because the editor used the old shl. Now the cmcJumpTo... ensures the shl
cache is filled with the proper values.<br>
<li> Added: A warning to the configset script as I did for DOS. BTW: What's
the shell command to wait for a keystroke? I just put a sleep 2 but this
isn't the best.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.331  2003/05/05 14:03:21  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option to control the size of newly opened files. When
enabled the windows tries to avoid overlapping the message and project
windows. The algorithm searchs for the bigger available rectangle that
doesn't overlap. The code also ensures a minimal size of 24x6 and ensures
the window is visible (not outside desktop). It was suggested by Ivn.<br>
<li> Documented and updated spanish translations.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.330  2003/05/05 13:57:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some pmacros (Perl was the most notable) didn't indicate the right
editing mode flags. It could make them fail to generate properly indented
text.<br>
<li> Fixed: "Intelligent indent" mode needed "Backspace unindents" enabled in
order to work as spected.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.329  2003/05/05 13:53:14  set<br>
<li> Added: A small tool I wrote to extract info from linker maps. Is quite
useful for DOS to know how much comes from each lib.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.328  2003/05/05 13:51:10  set<br>
<li> Added: A warning to configset.bat because people thinks thats "set
configuration" and not "configuration for SET" ;-)<br>
<li> Added: Now if shell utils aren't installed (I think djgpp is the only
that can lack it) the configuration stops and explains the problem.<br>
<li> Modified: gcc 3.x doesn't like (unsigned char)var when var is unsigned.<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] looks like djgpp defines time_t in a way that gcc can't
see the difference between time_t and unsigned.<br>
<li> Modified: Looks like gcc 3.2.2 (may be all 3.x) doesn't support the
__attribute__((constructor)) stuff for C++ code. So now I'm using C++ code
for that, which is quite logical but ugly.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.327  2003/05/05 13:45:13  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the tags file automagically maintained by the editor can't
be removed manually from the list of tag files. Also: it isn't saved to the
desktop file. Instead when you load a project the file is automatically
inserted.<br>
<li> Fixed: What Exuberant Ctags claims to be a regex isn't such a thing. For
this reaso any "regex" containing a pointer type (*) fails. For this reason
I changed the way it is used. Now I do a simple search but specifying
"whole words", it can fail, but I think it won't be usual to get a fail.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.326  2003/05/02 19:39:40  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now is possible to load projects outside the current working
directory. From a report by Grzegorz. Note it was tested only for Linux
(don't tested using drive letters).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.325  2003/05/02 12:45:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The modified CreateChooseDialog used cmOKApply and cmCancelApply
commands instead of cmOK and cmCancel. Reported by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.324  2003/04/30 20:28:34  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor wrongly interpreted the basic/extended regex option so
the real mode was in fact tied to the case sensitive option.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the tags code uses real regex.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.323  2003/04/30 19:34:19  set<br>
<li> Added: A button to search for members of a class, struct, enum or union
to the jump to tag dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.322  2003/04/30 18:00:19  set<br>
<li> Fixed: TSortedListBox using SOStacks have a special incremental search,
it had some bugs fixed in TV but not copied there.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.321  2003/04/30 16:05:59  set<br>
<li> Added: More documentation about tags.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.320  2003/04/30 14:23:02  set<br>
<li> Added: When you add an item to the project it doesn't have to be newer
than the TAGs file. For this reason I created a new filed in project items
to indicate the item is new and that it wasn't yet included in the tags
file. The concept currently allows the same for other 31 targets.<br>
<li> Updated: Web page.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.319  2003/04/30 13:18:25  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to maintain a central tags file using the project items.
This option checks if any of the project files is newer than the file
"tags" and if that's the case calls ctags using the -a option and passing
a list of files to scan. This makes ctags scan only the newer files saving
time.<br>
<li> Added: Support for tag files where "kind:" is implicit.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.318  2003/04/29 18:23:35  set<br>
<li> Added: Options to export the project items to a text file and to import
file names from a text file. Documented and linked to the docs.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.317  2003/04/29 15:04:51  set<br>
<li> Modified: CreateChooseDialog to use EasyDiag and made more configurable.<br>
<li> Added: TGrowDialogZ as a TGrowDialog that can handle cmeZoom.<br>
<li> Modified: TAGs code to reuse both things.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.316  2003/04/29 12:52:11  set<br>
<li> Added: A new member to EasyDiag objects to set the growMode option in an
easier way (setGrowMode).<br>
<li> Added: A button to the list of tag files to see the information stored by
the tags program (format, program version, etc.).<br>
<li> Modified: Redesigned the CreateAddInsDelDialog function using EasyDiag
and added a new option for an "Info." button. The code is much more simple
now.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.315  2003/04/29 12:50:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When doing a search in/outside comments close to the first line
and having the cursor in the line of the first hit and this line was longer
than the sum of the previous the editor evaluated line -1 generating a
GPF. Reported by Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.314  2003/04/28 19:42:28  set<br>
<li> Added: An advice dialog to warn about using tag files in format 1. And
a button to jump to docs.<br>
<li> Added: If the tags file to load is the default and couldn't be loaded
an advice about it with option to read the docs is used. If the user
doesn't go to the docs we detect if ctags is installed, if installed we
offer to generate a new tags files. If not installed we indicate the URL
of the homepage.<br>
<li> Fixed: Tips code tried to jump to editor.inf which is no longer called
like it. Does anybody read the tips?<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.313  2003/04/28 16:44:12  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The tags code to support: original tags format (FORMAT=1), wrong
tags files (Emacs tag files for example), backwards regex, etc. without
crashing. Basically: made more robust when dealing with unexpected tag
files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.312  2003/04/28 14:02:05  set<br>
<li> Added: Some documentation about the new TAGS features.<br>
<li> Added: Connected the context sensitive help values with the new
documentation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.311  2003/04/28 14:00:31  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<br>
<li> Fixed: Shortcut collision in class browser.<br>
<li> Removed: Some debugging printfs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.310  2003/04/28 13:58:19  set<br>
<li> Added: Word completion stuff! is based on the code I wrote for sLisp and
Lemur. I used Alt+Right for it but I'm not sure if that's a good idea.
Currently is only on user request, some options about it could be added.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.309  2003/04/28 13:56:15  set<br>
<li> Added: A class browser based on TAGs info. It allows to know which are
the parents and childs for a class, also which members are declared, jump
to any of them, see a list of the members plus the members of the parents
and more. I coded it in less than 5 hours, don't spect perfect code.<br>
<li> Added: A new constant called tsveMakeSameW, when used (with or) for
MakeVeGroup forces a call to makeSameW().<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.308  2003/04/28 13:54:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When a directory contained a project with a desktop file newer
than the current setedit version and a default desktop file from a version
older than 0.5.0 the editor rejected the new file but preloaded it doing
a mess at the time of loading the old file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.307  2003/04/28 13:53:33  set<br>
<li> Added: When adding a tag file to list now the editor asks if we want to
add it using a relative path.<br>
<li> Modified: The dialog to select a tag file now uses "tags*".<br>
<li> Added: The list of selected tag files is stored in the desktop file.<br>
<li> Version 0.5.1<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.306  2003/04/25 18:41:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When typing at the end of the visible area and a horizontal scroll
is forced the editor have to draw the whole window. To minimize the impact
the editor does an 8 columns scroll. But if this width was less than the
width of the larger line this scroll was automatically neutralized by the
horizontal scrollbar. It not only defeated the effect but also generated a
second full draw making things even worst.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.305  2003/04/25 18:15:10  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When jumping to a hit in the message window and the first column
contained a matching [{( and the editor was configure to do match pair on
the fly: the message quickly dissapear.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.304  2003/04/25 15:02:23  set<br>
<li> Fixed: TSCheckBoxes computed the with using untranslated messages. Same
for TSRadioButtons.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.303  2003/04/25 12:22:25  set<br>
<li> Added: Now you can jump to any symbol from the TAGS file! looks like I
can't get it working using real regex and also looks like they aren't real
regex, just full lines marked similar to regexs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.302  2003/04/24 20:05:11  set<br>
<li> Added: A new color scheme contributed by Juan Diego (bach) Ianelli
<jdibach@yahoo.com.ar>. Is called "Dark JDI".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.301  2003/04/24 19:24:19  set<br>
<li> At last!! finally I added some basic supoprt for TAGS. I had some code
I wrote in 1998, but I discarded it because ectags changed a lot. Currently
you can setup which tag files to use (the list isn't stored to disk) and
do a search pressing ^F2, for repited entries you'll even be able to jump
to the line where the symbol is defined, but in most cases the position is
obtained using regex and it isn't implemented yet. Be careful that's really
experimental. Also: forget about using it if the editor is linked with
efence and the tags file is big. I tried it with a 1.1 MB file and the
editor died after eating more than 240 MB of memory (efence seems to need
real memory, not swap).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.300  2003/04/22 15:32:56  set<br>
<li> Modified: To support the --with-ssc TV option.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.299  2003/04/21 19:38:34  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.298  2003/04/21 18:30:05  set<br>
<li> Modified: i18n files to remove TV messages, now they are in a separated
catalog (tvision domain).<br>
<li> Modified: The i18n initialization to use TVIntl::autoInit().<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.297  2003/04/21 18:25:37  set<br>
<li> Added: Copy/paste to/from OS clipboard to the list of i18n strings.<br>
<li> Fixed: Shortcut collision between it and file clipboard.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations, removed \r to shutup msgmerge.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.296  2003/04/21 18:23:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Color names now are coherent, all start with a capital letter.<br>
<li> Fixed: The f*ck#ng gettext doesn't like values outside ASCII in msgids so
I changed Robert's last name and put the correct value in the spanish
translation. Some day I'll discard GNU gettext in favor of a forked and
sane replacement.<br>
<li> Added: A small tool to extract the names of the colors for i18n.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.295  2003/04/21 18:16:20  set<br>
<li> Adapted: Most of the remaining use of the old TV i18n API.<br>
<li> Added: Various calls to snprintf (while adapting i18n).<br>
<li> Added: A small tool to extract msgids from TV's .po file.<br>
<li> Fixed: Spanish .po header (wrong encoding in comments).<br>
<li> Updated: TV i18n messages.<br>
<li> Fixed: Memory leak in about dialog.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.294  2003/04/21 18:07:16  set<br>
<li> Modified: No more use of strstream, now I use messageBox, easier code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.293  2003/04/16 20:29:42  set<br>
<li> Modified: All messageBox calls to the new i18n API.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.292  2003/04/10 21:39:42  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the i18n catalogs are in ISO-8859-1 encoding for all
targets. Under DOS they are recoded on-the-fly to get CP850.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some code in the installer that used _() as returning char *.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.291  2003/04/08 19:18:25  set<br>
<li> Modified: TWindow, TDialog and TButton use to follow TV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.290  2003/04/08 14:08:01  set<br>
<li> Modified: Uses of TStaticText incarnations to follow new TV features. I
hope the number of bugs is low ;-) This isn't really harmful but I think
some bugs are there.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.289  2003/04/07 13:48:38  set<br>
<li> Modified: all uses of TCheckBoxes and TRadioButtons to match the new TV
API. Now they also support code page changes on the fly.<br>
<li> Fixed: In the last MinGW fix to avoid annoying messages from the
configure script I forgot to assign the return value making recode,
xgettext and makeinfo detection to fail.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.288  2003/04/07 13:47:27  set<br>
<li> Modified: The menu and status line creation for the new TV i18n API. Now
they adapt to code page changes!<br>
<li> Modified: The configuration to request TV 2.0.2.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.287  2003/04/07 13:46:32  set<br>
<li> Modified: To adapt to the new TVIntl class, just compilation details.
More will come soon ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.286  2003/04/03 19:57:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Even when gettext (intl library) returns a char * it should be
used as a const char *. When I enforced it using the _() macro one wrong
use was detected and this change allows compilations for const char * as
return value.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.285  2003/04/02 13:40:10  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MinGW] The configuration script shown the error messages created
when running non-existent programs appear in the screen generating
confusion. Now the command are executed redirecting stderr.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.284  2003/04/02 13:39:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Warnings about: return value in TCEditor::loadFile (this is
because BC++ is idiot to detect the complete flow, but now the code is
more clear for the compiler and also for humans ;-), Comparisson between
unsigned char and unsigned int gave warnings (promotion to int?) in
edprefs.cc and assigment of bool to a Boolean variable. All reported by
BC++ 5.5 as warnings.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.283  2003/04/01 17:31:34  set<br>
<li> Added: The web site to CVS (for easier maintainance) and distro (for more
information for the user).<br>
<li> Updated: The web site for the last release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.282  2003/04/01 13:54:32  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.281  2003/04/01 03:44:38  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to version 0.5.0-1.<br>
<li> Modified: tell people to use the distribution name like for example
potato/woody instead of unstable/stable.
<hr>v0.5.0 [tagged as r0_5_0]<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.280  2003/03/21 18:02:58  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.279  2003/02/19 12:41:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Heuristic Perl parser didn't pay attention to the \ character, the
code looked for it but didn't increment the index properly. Reported by
Juan Diego Iannelli <jdibach@yahoo.com.ar><br>
<li> Added: New keywords used in experimental TV for their configuration file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.278  2003/02/11 13:41:01  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.277  2003/02/11 13:32:11  set<br>

date of the last documentation change.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.276  2003/02/06 18:55:29  set<br>
<li> Added: Save all option to save all unsaved editors. As suggested by
lvaro (Cristina ;-) and Ivn.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.275  2003/01/31 15:55:59  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When "match pair on the fly" was enabled the editor forced a
center cursor periodically interfering with the movement using the scroll
bars. Reported by Ivn and lvaro.
<hr>v0.5.0 Release Candidate 1<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.274  2003/01/29 12:45:58  set<br>

and we are preparing for a release candidate.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.273  2003/01/28 12:56:50  set<br>
<li> Added: Last changes to distrib files in order to release the RC1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.272  2003/01/17 17:56:19  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] glibc 2.3.x deprecates the use of sys_errlist and
the replacement (strerror) is available in glibc 2.2.x so now for
glibc>=2.2.0 I use it. Reported by Andris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.271  2003/01/17 14:34:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The function list failed for namespace::class::member()
declarations. Reported by Andris.<br>
<li> Fixed: It also failed for function(namespace::identifier).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.270  2003/01/08 15:01:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Bug in match pair highlight on the fly, using the wrong line as
shl reference. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.269  2003/01/07 19:57:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Wrong SHL parsing of empty lines that propagates strings when they
are under edition. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.268  2003/01/07 19:12:54  set<br>
<li> Modified: The SQL syntax to properly understand MySQL and PostgreSQL
comments.<br>
<li> Modified: Gave more priority to comments than simple symbols, should be
carefully tested but it made SQL comments to fail. From Ivan report.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.267  2003/01/06 20:18:22  set<br>
<li> Added: An explanation about how to install setedit in the home directory
and use it from any machine with access to it. Contributed by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Modified: Some macros to work with the Texinfo provided by Woody.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.266  2003/01/06 13:54:09  set<br>

portions of text.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.265  2002/12/30 15:28:22  set<br>
<li> Updated: POVRay SHL, from Martijn.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.264  2002/12/30 15:24:44  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed the line len limitation in the syntaxhighlight loader.
Asked by Martijn, he used more than 100 columns for POVRay SHL ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.263  2002/12/27 12:40:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Added/Removed entries to the list of files.<br>
<li> Added: A chmod to make the INSTALL script executable when generating the
packages.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.262  2002/12/20 15:44:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Ivan forgot to comment STANDALONE in pphp.cc.<br>
<li> Added: A new environment variable: SET_LOCALEDIR. It tells to the editor
where to look for i18n files. That's useful when you have to install in the
home directory. From a problem pointed out by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: Info about the new environment variable to the manpage and the
Linux FAQ.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.261  2002/12/14 23:00:14  terrible<br>
<li> Modified: PHP Functions Parser: added benchmark results and a EXTRA_INLINE
macro to activate the inlines that cause bloat but speed things (yes! because
they are on the hot path and used very often), the default is to not inline
those extra functions when compiling for the editor but inlining when
compiling standalone. The default parameters on the function definitions are
commented out instead of just not being there, I prefer that for code
clarity.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.260  2002/12/12 19:05:39  set<br>
<li> Removed the cmeKeyboardSetUp option, it no longer exists. Now this is
controlled by the input code page.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.259  2002/12/12 19:04:31  set<br>
<li> Modified: The greek keyboard tweak no longer compiles. Removed the code
that prevented compilation.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.257  2002/12/10 18:27:55  set<br>
<li> Added: Last TV config keyword.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.256  2002/12/10 14:13:55  set<br>
<li> Added: Missing header for fonts conversion utility.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.255  2002/12/09 13:23:53  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Commented out atStartOfComment in pphp.cc, it isn't used.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.254  2002/12/09 13:23:11  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed a lot of inline declarations in pphp.cc. They aren't
good candidates for inline functions (no speed gain and code bloated).
BC++ 5.5 made warnings about them.<br>
<li> Fixed: un/signed comparisson in editmain.cc.<br>
<li> Modified: BC++ 5.5 doesn't like empty declarations produced by 2
consecutive ;.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.253  2002/12/09 13:21:39  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] gdi32 is needed to link. (new WinGr driver)<br>
<li> Fixed: configuration library to output less error messages during tests.<br>
<li> Fixed: default values in function declarations used in pphp.cc.<br>
<li> Modified: [MinGW] edprefs.cc to workaround a name space pollution in
MinGW headers. (grp1 and grp2).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.252  2002/12/09 13:07:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] The greek hack. It should go away.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.251  2002/12/09 13:06:10  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug in the painting shl routine used for user defined syntax
highlights. Failed for commented lines starting with blank spaces
(specially tabs) and with text after the end of comment.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.250  2002/12/05 17:09:43  set<br>
<li> Added: Spanish translations for "Save as DOS" and "Shell". Pointed out
by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.249  2002/12/04 21:25:46  terrible<br>
<li> Corrected typo in change.log: spect should be expect.<br>
<li> Tested the editor, the Debian packaging didn't need any changes!<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.248  2002/12/03 12:36:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor configured the secondary font using "screen" encoding
at start-up.<br>
<li> Fixed: We didn't signal the need of loading a secondary font at start-up,
I forgot to implement it in TV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.247  2002/12/03 12:35:53  set<br>
<li> Added: [DOS] FAQ entry explaining that NT doesn't implement WinOldAP and
hence you can't copy/paste using it.<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] I heavily modified the Linux FAQ because now we have
the X11 driver and it should remove most of the annoying limitations. I
also added an entry explaining how to give access to /dev/vcs* to users.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.246  2002/12/03 12:35:10  set<br>
<li> Modified: Default global settings to be more similar to what a Windows
user expects. Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.245  2002/12/03 12:34:18  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed all the conditionals for TV<2 and modified the
configure script to request TV>=2.0.1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.244  2002/12/03 12:32:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The special lines that doesn't exist are 0 and not -1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.243  2002/12/03 12:31:56  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The KeyPad behavior. It is only for DOS driver. TV 2.0.1 is
needed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.242  2002/12/03 12:31:19  set<br>
<li> Added: More InfView commands to the commands parser used for sLisp and
Menu files. I renamed the chcd* commands to cmh* so they can be parsed.
I added a test example to the menubind.smn file. Closes SF FR #645731
created by Martijn.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.241  2002/11/29 12:50:22  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now TV provides CLY_Beep for all platforms.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.240  2002/11/27 17:35:12  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When using Linux (without VCS access) and XTerm drivers and
calling a child process in background the child shared the output file
handle producing a nasty side effect. Now the stdout and stderr are dup2'ed
in the child using the redirected file.<br>
<li> Fixed: When creating new entries in the project they had an empty resume
and it made the editor bomb at load time. Introduced by Ivan's request ...
I knew it will blow something ;-), now the editor fills the propper field
before saving and also workarounds wrong projects.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.239  2002/11/27 13:11:58  set<br>
<li> Added: A resumed list of new and fixed stuff to the distribution list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.238  2002/11/26 12:51:12  set<br>
<li> Added: An LRU algorithm to remove entries in the closed list, as
suggested by Ivan. I changed (once again) the resume structure to add the
time stamp of the resume. Expect all kind of stupid side effects, flames
go to Ivan for the idea ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.237  2002/11/26 12:50:17  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The GetSelection sLisp command read one extra character in a
string copy. Only detectable thanks to efence (not harmful).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.236  2002/11/20 17:33:51  terrible<br>
<li> Fixed: the editor didn't like the carriage returns, tabs, etc. that the PHP
parser was giving to him which is something very understandable, so we
replace them toghether with comments (they disturb in the function list) by
a single space.<br>
<li> Fixed: off by 1 error on the PHP parser, tAddFunc function expects len to
be the length of the string _including_ the ending 0 instead of the real
length.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.235  2002/11/12 14:09:15  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [configuration] The --without-aa option didn't work. Reported by
Martijn Versteegh.<br>
<li> Fixed: [configuration] After disabling MP3 support it was impossible to
enable it again without deleting the cache file. From a report by Martijn.<br>
<li> Added: The new parser to BC++ and MSVC makefiles.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.234  2002/11/12 13:12:39  set<br>
<li> Added: Linked the PHP Parser that Ivn added to the list of available
parsers. I'll think about the indentation, after all my "weird" indentation
is almost the same used by GNU project ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.233  2002/11/11 21:47:40  terrible<br>
<li> Modified: added bool, true, false, typename and using to the C++ syntax
highlight (both the .shl file and editmain.cc).<br>
<li> Added: PHP heuristic parser for function jumps and class recognition.
Note: needs to be added to the building process and bufun.h, I don't have
RHIDE so I can't do that myself, thanks :).
Note 2: I am not as good as Salvador coding, but at least my indentation
isn't so weird :-D, though if it is needed, I would indent it with Salvador's
exotic style :-D, but if I am going to maintain it, I would prefer that it
remains with my indentation style if possible.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.232  2002/11/11 20:15:58  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the matchpair and the complementary element jumps are affected
by the syntax highlight. It was in the Feature Request for a long time and
Ivan annoyed me to add it. It should be tested but seems to work,
complementary elements only match if they belong to the same shl context.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.231  2002/11/11 17:43:20  set<br>
<li> Added: Now if you unindent uncommenting the editor checks that at least
the first line is already indented, if not the operation is aborted.<br>
<li> Fixed: When indenting a block using the arbitrary indent or comment
indent the syntax highlight wasn't recomputed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.230  2002/11/11 16:21:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug introduced by the 1.197 (SF number) revision. It fixed
problems in the overwrite undo but introduced problems in the normal
overwrite use ;-). Now I reverted part of the patch and added a specific
fix. *** Overwrite still unstable ***<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.229  2002/11/08 12:42:45  set<br>
<li> Added: Some keywords to HTML syntax highlight.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.228  2002/11/08 12:40:44  set<br>
<li> Added: A very limited XML syntax highlight, I'm trying to learn about it
so it currently highlights what I know ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.227  2002/11/06 16:17:04  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to generate HTML 4.01 + CSS in the HTML export.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.226  2002/11/05 13:15:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: applycvs.pl failed to apply new files in the root of the module.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.225  2002/11/05 13:13:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now when choosing to "never remember windows" the options "resume"
isn't applied. Note it was possible to choose such a behavior by choosing
not to remmember the cursor position. From a suggestion by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.224  2002/10/29 14:58:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When specifying a new project from command line the preLoad
mechanism failed giving a SIGSEGV. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: When specifying an existing project from command line the preload
mechanism loaded the right desktop file but the second pass loaded the
default desktop. From a report by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to indicate a project to load without the
extension in the command line. From a report by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.223  2002/10/24 18:07:12  set<br>
<li> Added: "latex" to the TeX extensions. Suggested by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.222  2002/10/07 19:25:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The "insert key name" option was broken for TV 2.0.0.<br>
<li> Added: / to PHP symbols as suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.221  2002/10/04 01:01:10  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to version 0.5.0-0.4.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.220  2002/10/02 13:08:30  set<br>
<li> Added: A cursor restore after closing AAlib. That's just to test if it
solves the SF issue #617251 submitted by Grzegorz. But I think this is a
bug in AAlib or Linux kernel. I can't reproduce it in my system.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.219  2002/10/02 12:59:50  set<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for the new Screen, Encodings and Fonts options.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.218  2002/09/23 12:45:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed?: The TDskWin wrappers for InfView and the Clipboard deleted the
windows intead of closing them. This can originate the use of already
deleted objects because they remain inserted in the desktop. I saw it with
efence, but I wonder why it wasn't exposed before, that's why I'm not sure
about this fix.<br>
<li> Fixed: The TDskWinPrj() objects didn't set the wS and hS members when a
new project was created giving crazy window sizes when loading the desktop.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.217  2002/09/23 12:43:30  set<br>
<li> Added: More TV configuration file keywords.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.216  2002/09/20 16:32:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor didn't allow to save ReadOnly files using "Save As",
that's the only way we have to make a ReadWrite copy, so now that's
allowed. Before writing the status is changed to RW and if the save goes
wrong is reverted to RO.<br>
<li> Fixed: The selection adjust done when we leave a line under edition
failed if the line had extra spaces at the end. I don't understand why the
code comment said the right thing and the code had it wrong.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.215  2002/09/18 12:33:44  set<br>
<li> Added: DontMoveHiddenCursor to the tvrc syntax hl.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.214  2002/09/18 12:32:43  set<br>
<li> Added: The new TV config variables for DOS and XTerm drivers.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.213  2002/09/16 14:43:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The MP3 window character wasn't remapped after the last change.<br>
<li> Added: The last TV configuration keywords to the shl file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.212  2002/09/13 12:30:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Lack of string.h in edfonts.cc. Reported by Anton Ustyancev
<anton@cinvest.chel.su>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.211  2002/09/13 12:28:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Lack of Uses_TVCodePage in loadfunc.cc when compiling using
djgpp.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] When using the editor without djgpp the editor failed to
find the internationalization files. Reported by Alex Lozano.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.210  2002/09/12 18:15:27  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed code that used cmcUpdateCodePage, no longer needed.<br>
<li> Fixed: When loading a desktop that used fonts the code didn't indicate
the font was loaded and hence encoding changes didn't change the font
encoding.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.209  2002/09/12 18:14:17  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When the desktop file for a project was missing the loading
routine didn't signal the "pre-load" state skipping the screen data
initialization and hence generating a SIGSEGV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.208  2002/09/12 18:13:31  set<br>
<li> Modified: The default ManView colors as suggested by Ivan, now they are
more coherent with InfView.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.207  2002/09/12 01:16:26  terrible<br>
<li> Fixed: typo in internac/es.po.<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to version 0.5.0-0.3.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.206  2002/09/11 13:14:32  set<br>
<li> Big code clean-up, I hope it isn't a big code breakage ;-)<br>
<li> Modified: all references to ctype functions to use TVCodePage members.<br>
<li> Added: application and input code page settings to InfView. Changed
version to 0.2.8.<br>
<li> Modified: Removed old code in codepage.cc and adapted InfView and SETEdit
to only use the new TV code.<br>
<li> Modified: Removed old code in edfonts.cc.<br>
<li> Updated: Project dependencies.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.205  2002/09/11 12:58:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The encoding options dialog failed to revert default values when
the user disabled the "force" option.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.204  2002/09/10 19:07:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Big Endian] the hexadecimal syntax highlight could use unaligned
memory.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.203  2002/09/10 17:30:07  set<br>
<li> Modified: The code pages dialog to show what currently is used by the
driver in the cps that aren't forced.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.202  2002/09/09 20:51:39  set [uid61297 <= Ugh! SF bug!]<br>
<li> Modified: removed code used for old screen options dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.201  2002/09/09 13:33:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView compilation detail, problem introduced in last rev (1.715
in my home CVS 1.200 @SF)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.200  2002/09/09 13:32:41  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for the secondary OS clipboard to InfView (X11 selection).<br>
<li> Added: Support fot copy from man page to: editor's clipboard, main OS
clipboard and secondary OS clipboard.<br>
<li> Removed: Old code I used to compile InfView with Sigala's port. Also
removed some TV 1.x code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.199  2002/09/06 20:56:11  set<br>
<li> Added: The first steps towards selection support in the manpage viewer.
Isn't functional yet. Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.198  2002/09/06 18:47:01  terrible<br>
<li> Updated Debian packaging to 0.5.0-2.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.197  2002/09/06 16:12:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug in the undo of text typed while using overwrite mode. It
could unsynchronize the cursor position. Is amazing it was there after so
much time. And the next is even worst:<br>
<li> Fixed: When typing in overwrite mode the line length was wrongly
computed. It wasn't too bad because it is computed again when the line is
flushed but originated some nasty syntax highlight errors.<br>
<li>** The fixes seems ok, but the overwrite mode should be temporally
    considered unstable ***
Both found while testing David's report.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.196  2002/09/06 15:27:18  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When restoring the settings of a closed window (or project item)
the "overwrite" status wasn't reflected in the cursor shape. Reported by
David A. Capello <dacap@users.sourceforge.net><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.195  2002/09/06 00:10:28  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to version 0.5.0-0.1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.194  2002/09/04 20:32:32  set<br>
<li> Added: When the editor loads a file the "busy indicator" is used.<br>
<li> Fixed: Added some rounding to the resume computations to make them more
accurate.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some problems that made the editor crash when opening a file from
the windows list dialog and this process needed to show a messageBox. In
this case the "closed file" entry was deleted but the list box didn't know
it. So now is protected against it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.193  2002/09/04 18:16:48  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now editor "resumes" stores coordinates in a relative way. The
screen is 100% == 16384. When restoring the values they are computed
according to the current screen size. In this way closed windows that were
opened using another screen size are restored correctly.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.192  2002/09/04 15:46:21  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.191  2002/09/04 13:14:37  set<br>
<li> Added: The project windows are resized accroding to the desktop file when
loading. Till now all the windows (from the dst) were resized but the
project window (from the epr) wasn't. With this is quite smooth to load a
project that was used with another desktop size.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.190  2002/09/04 13:13:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The TVOSClipboard::paste member returns a new[] allocated array
and it should be freed usind delete[].<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.189  2002/09/04 13:13:04  set<br>
<li> Modified: The middle button insert text at the cursor position not at the
mouse position. I found the previous behavior annoying.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.188  2002/09/03 13:48:26  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Error in docs about delete left/right word. Reported by Chris
Impens <ci@cage.rug.ac.be>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.187  2002/09/03 13:45:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now old desktop file information is also loaded translating to
the new structure when isn't preloaded. Complex, no? :-P<br>
<li> Modified: I reworked most of the palette stuff to adapt to the new
scheme. Now the palettes are stored in disk only if changed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.186  2002/09/02 13:58:40  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the driver dependent settings are stored in the desktop file.
For this reason the desktop file format changed and I'm switching to
version 0.5.0. Consider it ***UNSTABLE***<br>
<li> Version: 0.5.0<br>
<li> Added: The code needed to adapt to a desktop file change once we are
already initialized (change of project for example). This seems to work,
but I'm quite sure is full of bugs.<br>
<li> Note: I was able to have different settings for X11 and Linux drivers in
the same desktop file and properly handle a project with another fonts
loaded. But it was hard to get working so I think a lot of work will be
needed before it works for all the cases.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.185  2002/09/02 13:54:41  set<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] Now -b/B are now deprecated in favor of the BIOSKey TV
configuration option, but is supported.<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] Ctrl+Break is now blocked, the idiot that put Break just
above PageUp should be killed.<br>
<li> Added: BIOSKey TV config keyword.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.184  2002/09/02 13:53:49  set<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] The installer now uses cwsdpmi and a regular stub. I
changed it because A) A user reported problems in SF bug tracker and B)
cwsdpmi is much more reliable than pmodedj. SF bug #594116.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.183  2002/08/27 17:21:41  set<br>
<li> Added: DontResizeToCells TV configuration keyword.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.182  2002/08/26 13:41:48  set<br>
<li> Added: ExtProgVideoMode and VideoMode TV config file keywords.<br>
<li> Added: More code for the video mode options. Next step will be save the
options.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.181  2002/08/26 13:40:48  set<br>
<li> Modified: Moved edHelper and clipWindow to the main class.<br>
<li> Modified: Moved some global functions related to the load desktop to the
class as statics. Also modified some code to adapt for it.<br>
<li> Modified: More code for the driver settings stuff, added a function to
transfer the loaded values to the "config file" TV tree, the so member is
now a pointer to the settings for the current driver in the settings
collection, etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.180  2002/08/23 15:22:46  set<br>
<li> Added: HideCursorWhenNoFocus tvrc keyword.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.179  2002/08/23 14:10:21  set<br>
<li> Added: ScreenPalette to the tvrc syntax highlight.<br>
<li> Added: More code to the preLoadDesktop, now is loading all the screen
information from old desktop files.<br>
<li> Added: Implemented TScOptsCol this collection will hold the settings for
each driver.<br>
<li> Modified: Palette code to support the preload.<br>
<li> Modified: Removed more TV 1.x compatibility code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.178  2002/08/20 14:23:28  set<br>
<li> Added: First step towards loading screen options before starting TV. It
implies a "pre-load" of the desktop file loading only the screen related
stuff. Currently I'm implementing what will become the "compatibility"
code. The new desktop files (0.5.0) will store it in a better way and will
have separated options for each driver.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.177  2002/08/13 13:38:59  set<br>
<li> Added: UseSecondaryFont TVRC keyword.<br>
<li> Fixed: I declared some const char * const members as const char *. MSVC
detected the subtle difference, gcc nor BC++ detected it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.176  2002/08/12 16:34:15  set<br>
<li> Modified: Moved all the new screen related options to a structure and
it + the functions to the main program class.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.175  2002/08/12 16:33:23  set<br>
<li> Added: Configuration for the new "Input Code Page". I succesfully edited
a text encoded in CP 850 using X. The library translated ISO-1 input into
CP850 codes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.174  2002/08/12 16:32:26  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MinGW] Configure script to avoid generating rules for doc and
internac. The MinGW tools I tested fail to make this targets. I think the
reasons are: buggy makeinfo and command line length limitations in gettext
tools.<br>
<li> Modified: Included internac/po_list in the distribution, it can be
generated using Perl but MinGW and Cygwin generates GPFs when running the
perl script.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.173  2002/08/12 16:31:18  set<br>
<li> Modified: The default menu to say "Shell" instead of "DOS shell".<br>
<li> Added: "Window|User screen" disabled if it doesn't exist.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.172  2002/08/12 16:30:31  set<br>
<li> Added: Code to avoid calling a shell if TScreen::noUserScreen() returns
True. Also for InfView and for the Run Program "Use OS screen" option.<br>
<li> Modified: Removed some TV 1.x code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.171  2002/08/12 16:23:21  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Read out of bounds in man page viewer (detected by efence).<br>
<li> Fixed: The ASCII window grown after a window resize.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.170  2002/08/12 16:22:27  set<br>
<li> Added: Copyright information about the fonts and convpcf1.cc<br>
<li> Modified: The fonts dialog to keep the sizes well sorted, the
alphabetical way is useless. Now is sorted by width and height (in this
order).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.169  2002/08/12 16:18:20  set<br>
<li> Added: Three incomplete SFT files and a simple program to generate them
from raw fonts. They just contain the first 256 symbols (CP 437) and in
some cases the real symbols are just in the ASCII range the others are
regular.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.168  2002/08/12 16:15:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Memory leaks in the new fonts code.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.167  2002/07/30 17:46:54  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to 0.4.57-0.4.<br>
<li> Modified: my email changed from lubaldo to ibaldo.<br>
<li> Broked: everything, this is a sabotage!, SET is on vacations!!!<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.166  2002/07/25 17:25:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView changed to use unique_name, but as it was working it
didn't copy the real file name to the referenced buffer and it made InfView
fail to remove temporal files used to uncompress .info files. Now
unique_name does the copy. It didn't affect UNIX systems.<br>
<li> Modified: All the calls to unique_name using 0 as second parameter (is
the default value).<br>
<li> Added: A fonts request call back, so now if you change the video mode and
the new mode uses a font with a different size the call back can provide
it. Currently it only helps for DOS.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.165  2002/07/24 20:03:22  set<br>
<li> Added: The "Fonts" dialog now works, the options aren't stored to disk
yet but you can play with it. I tested a 2 fonts configuration under X11
and put a snapshot in the site.<br>
<li> Fixed: The command line option -d N generated a SIGSEGV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.164  2002/07/23 16:38:25  set<br>
<li> Added: [MSVC] /verbose to the link stage to get more information about
the linking problems.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.158  2002/07/19 20:45:54  set<br>
<li> Roll back of bzlib patch.<br>
<li> Modified: [MSVC] makefile to avoid command line limitations. Untested.<br>
<li> Fixed: Collisions between spec.cc and edspec.cc reported by MSVC from
output by WintiX.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.157  2002/07/19 14:44:57  set<br>
<li> Fixed: bzip2 newer than 1.x uses BZ2_bzlibVersion and my test only tried
bzlibVersion. Pointed out by Andris.<br>
<li> Added: Search for TV in /usr/local for all UNIX systems. Patch by Andris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.156  2002/07/19 14:03:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Unconditional MP3 code pull in editmain.cc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.155  2002/07/17 17:27:32  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [MSVC] The following sequence: type */* comment */ doesn't confuse
gcc nor SETEdit, but makes MSC emit a warning. From output by WintiX.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.154  2002/07/16 19:40:09  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.150  2002/07/12 16:48:42  set<br>
<li> Modified: [MSVC] avoided the inclusion of bzlib.h from ceditor.cc because
it includes windows.h and this hence collides. Also removed _WIN32 from
bzlib compilation, it doesn't have any sense for static link. Problem
found from cl preprocessor output sent by WintiX.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.149  2002/07/11 19:14:00  set<br>

<li> Added: Support for the new TVOSClipboard I added to Turbo Vision 2.0
replacing the old extra/winoldap.cc code.<br>
<li> Added: Support for a secondary OS clipboard used to copy/paste
selections. That's for the X11 XA_PRIMARY selection mechanism. Now every

middle mouse button does the paste.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.135  2002/06/28 12:37:20  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A read out of bounds in the input line of the calculator. I must
check it better because I think that's a bug in Turbo Vision. It isn't

<li> Fixed: When starting the editor with a remmembered file that no longer
exists located in a directory where we don't want backups the editor
removed the dektop structure from the list and inmediatly used it. This
wasn't detected until it happend with efence linked.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.126  2002/06/20 20:09:42  set<br>

but can be used.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.123  2002/06/19 14:59:24  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.118  2002/06/10 13:12:16  set<br>
<li> Updated: README to clarify a little bit the available Win32 options. I
tested MinGW+MSys+SiePerl as suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Fixed: When no intl lib is available we must try using tvfintl (provided
by TV lib).<br>
<li> Fixed: Targets where the prefix have back-slashes. The prefix is used in
the code and must contain escaped back-slashes.<br>
<li> Added: palconv.h and palfte.h to the distribution.<br>
<li> Fixed: patchenv.pl now is more cleaver and solves problems introduced in
last RHIDE versions. I tried gprexp as Robert suggested but it make things
even worst.<br>
<li> Fixed: PCRE for Win32 targets defaults to a DLL, avoided in editmain.cc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.117  2002/06/10 13:11:19  set<br>
<li> Modified: When the editor fails to load a desktop file (wrong version,

<b>Revision</b> 1.115  2002/06/10 13:08:36  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for try/catch not in the body of a C++ function for the
list of functions. It passes a couple of tests Andris sent me.<br>
<li> Fixed: C++ operators parsing in the list of functions.<br>
<li> Modified: Now if we find two identical functions (most probably only one
is really used at compile time) both are listed in the list of functions.
To differentiate the functions the starting line is added.<br>
<li> Fixed: A search in the list functions stack wasted extra stack space.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.114  2002/06/10 13:07:28  set<br>
<li> Added: A script to apply the synmail patches to my CVS copy at home.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.113  2002/06/07 19:03:34  set<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] the configuration to test if the X11 include directory
is really needed. It looks like gcc 3.1 gives a warning if this is manually
specified. Is a test because I don't have gcc 3.1 for Linux. Reported by
Andris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.112  2002/06/07 02:18:36  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging with small changes.<p>

<li> Modified: To use the moved TView::specialChars (TV 2.0).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.108  2002/06/04 13:26:30  set<br>
<li> Modified: I dropped the code that workarounds all bugs in libstdc++. I
think it was in gcc 2.7.x or perhaps 2.6.3. The code still there but just
disabled. This will allow working with the new gcc 3.1 that drops any
kind of C++ connected to a C stream/file handle.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.107  2002/06/03 13:53:02  set<br>

<li> Modified: [Solaris] Removed debug printfs in audio code.<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] Added some code that should avoid big endian issues
with the sample format, Martijn van Buul, needs testing.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.102  2002/05/27 19:36:23  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Solaris] the audio problems, now we can play MP3!! The big endian
issue was solved with the help of Martijn van Buul <pino@dohd.org> (PowerPC
user of a library derived from splay) and Mikael Hedin <mikael.hedin@irf.se>
currently maintainer of splay. I also fixed some stuff in the Solaris
audio code, now seems to work quite nice.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.101  2002/05/20 18:08:31  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.97  2002/05/17 14:29:56  set<br>
<li> Added: The first part of Grzegorz request about adding options to create
message and project windows in the vertical direction.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.96  2002/05/17 14:27:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The show match pair on the fly without waiting had another
interaction with the syntax highlight computation (I already fixed one).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.95  2002/05/16 21:24:21  set<br>
<li> Fixed: TV link in copyrigh.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.94  2002/05/16 21:23:44  set<br>
<li> Modified: When the editor generates code for a recorded macro it now uses
\t instead of an ASCII 9 embedded in the string. Suggested by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.93  2002/05/15 19:05:39  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Default CFLAGS for FreeBSD used -L/usr/local/include. Reported by
miniEleph (Andrew 'Onyx' Shevtsov).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.92  2002/05/14 14:40:12  set<br>
<li> Added: Now mpegsound library should detect SPARC as big endian. I don't
know if it will be enough to get it working for Suns.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.91  2002/05/13 18:33:44  set<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] tar detection according to miniEleph info and separated
tar from gzip calls. Is easier to find tar + gzip than GNU tar (-z option)
+ gzip.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.90  2002/05/13 15:59:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Endian issues related to drawLines when filling the empty lines
at the end of files. Tested in an Ultra SPARC 60 thanks to Alex.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.89  2002/05/13 13:45:48  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When I switched to unique_name the code that converts UNIX->DOS
and DOS->UNIX left the temporal. Now fixed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.88  2002/05/13 12:50:21  set<br>
<li> Test: for big endian issue.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.87  2002/05/13 12:41:04  set<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] Now the FHS detection is more strict, the existance of
share/doc is not enough, share/man and shared/info must exist.<br>
<li> Fixed: [UNIX] The FHS detection looks in $prefix and not in /usr.<br>
<li> Added: [FreeBSD] According to miniEleph in this case /share/doc is used
but not shared/info nor shared/man.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.86  2002/05/13 12:36:53  set<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] Now the INSTALL.LINUX script is just called INSTALL.
The script will work for FreeBSD and Solaris and is stupid to ask a BSD
user to run "INSTALL.LINUX" ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.85  2002/05/13 12:32:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Currently gettext is preconfigured only for djgpp so we should
copy the djgpp.h to config.h header anyways.<br>
<li> Fixed: confignt.pl used winnt directory instead of WinNT.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the INSTALL.MAK file is configured to reflect the
configured prefix (it was failing) and to support Solaris install tool.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.84  2002/05/13 12:30:28  set<br>
<li> Modified: Commented what parts of the Rawplayer class is really needed by
the editor and what sizes are used (bytes, not samples). I also modified
Solaris code to implement things this way.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.83  2002/05/08 13:48:54  set<br>
<li> Added: A new color scheme contributed by Thiago. It is dark (console
style) plus some VIM like SHL.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.82  2002/05/07 12:54:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: palfte.h didn't end with \n and failed for gcc 3.x. Patch by
Andris.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.80  2002/05/06 14:52:08  set.<br>
<li> Added: X11R6 include directory to the configuration script. It looks like
this directory isn't automagically included in FreeBSD. Also added options
to configure it -x-include and -x-lib. Reported by miniEleph
<nyxo@dnuc.polyn.kiae.su>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.79  2002/05/02 19:35:38  set<br>
<li> Modified: The use of tmpnam, now I use unique_name, based on mkstemp. It
seems to be more secure.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.78  2002/05/02 19:34:13  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for Electric Fence to the configuration script.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.77  2002/05/02 19:33:22  set<br>
<li> Added: libdl detection to config.pl. Looks like some new library
combinations (XFree86 4.2.0 + glibc 2.2.5) needs it. Time will say if this
should be more optional. From problems reported by Andris to create a
static editor with X11 support.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.76  2002/04/30 19:40:13  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView to compile with TV 2.0. As Andris tried to test it and
couldn't I though it was time to fix the problems ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.75  2002/04/30 18:08:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Ctrl+Arrows support to InfView. Suggested by Thiago (I think other
people asked for it, Ivan?).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.74  2002/04/30 18:00:55  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to save a desktop file in the current directory. Useful
for users that use a central desktop and don't want to create a project.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.73  2002/04/30 17:56:12  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now ~/setedit/.tcedit.dst have more priority than ~/tcedit.dst.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.66  2002/04/22 19:00:05  set<br>
<li> Modified: Some details to cleanly compile under FreeBSD. Some details
still need a solution. Some things changed: use of gmake instead of make,
use of time in favor of ftime, support for BSD find, use of intl lib,
default prefix, etc. From patches by miniEleph <nyxo@dnuc.polyn.kiae.su><p>

desktop or one each dir, 2) Use of tabs or spaces for indentation and 3)
Backup files creation. Currently this file is created by a simple perl
script called by INSTALL.LINUX but I'll incorporate it to DOS/Win32
installer and maybe Ivan will add it to the .deb options. Suggested by Ivan<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.33 SF 2001/12/04 15:15:17  set<br>
<li> Modified: The macros.slp file, I commented Lemur macros until a copy is
available for the public. I also added some macros contributed by Thiago.
They are good examples but most of them are commented because they eat
memory and aren't 100% generic.<p>

the message window. Suggested by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.512  2001/12/04 02:28:14  set<br>
<li> Added: A new sLisp command contributed by Thiago: EvalString, it
evaluates a string as sLisp code.<br>
<li> Fixed: Evaluate selected sLisp code didn't flush the line in edition.<br>
<li> Fixed: The sLisp interpreter didn't release the objects in the sLisp
stack when an error ocurred. It generated memory leaks. It was this way
because in this way was easier to report the exact point of the error
without risking to use memory that we freed. It changed the strategy and I
think this code must be tested and perhaps a branch will be needed if we'll
release a 0.4.52 again.
To achieve it now the code snapshot is taked just when the error appears.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some GetXXXX sLisp variable macros tried to use the returned
object even if it was NULL generating SIGSEGVs.<br>
<li> Note: Most of this was triggered by a report by Thiago about problems to
implement the new command.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.511  2001/12/03 23:55:52  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The ^Z key had a collision in the "redmond.smn" file. It was

only by the menu and the redmond.smn doesn't have a short-cut for scroll
up. Reported by David J. Hughes <David.J.Hughes@nokia.com>.<br>

sLisp macro. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some old kibind.dat files could have commands with garbage in the
upper 16 bits, it produce problems to show the name of this commands. Now
the editor limits the values to 16 bits before trying to find the name.
Reported by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.505  2001/11/28 00:08:29  set<br>
<li> Modified: The sLisp 'Test RunProgram Filter' example to avoid running or
pasting empty strings.<br>
<li> Fixed: sLisp if statement, it evaluated more than once the things. It was
a side effect of a macro. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: It wasn't possible to use ' and " in sLisp commands, was
interpreted as a string start.<br>
<li> Fixed: It wasn't possible to put a comment just after a number in sLisp.<br>
<li> Fixed: When calling RunProgram* sLisp command passing an empty string as
command to execute it was telling something about configuring it in the
options menu. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>

a SIGSEGV.<p>

<li> Fixed: [sLisp] When returning a variable that belongs to the stack (not a
fresh copy) I used the MLIRetObj, but it didn't mark the variable as
"floating" and hence was released from the stack. The result was that when
used it was already released containing garbage or the original value or
invalid pointers (random). I was exposed only if the variable wasn't the
return value of a expression. It made cond to fail.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.490  2001/11/07 00:22:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView crashed when loading desktops of older versions. Reported
by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.489  2001/11/07 00:10:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The indent uncomenting was taking an extra line. Reported by
Thiago.<br>
<li> Fixed: The undo of the indent commenting let the rectangle selection
visible.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.488  2001/11/06 01:17:37  set<br>
<li> Modified: Reverted to non-BIOS keyboard by default. The BIOS stuff discards
very used combinations. I put it in the FAQ and also modified the readme.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.487  2001/11/06 01:04:10  set<br>
<li> Added: Mazovia code page. That's a polish code page based on PC437. It
discards some accents that aren't used by polish and puts the needed chars
there. Piotr <piotr@asco.biz.pl> asked for it and helped me to add it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.23  2001/11/02 21:17:28  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to 0.4.51-3.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.486  2001/10/31 03:03:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When the editor was configured to forget about opened windows when
specifying new files in the command line the editor put the old files in
the list of closed files allowing to recover them easilly and remmembering
things like window position and size. But the editor failed to remmember
the cursor position. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.485  2001/10/31 01:57:14  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The new compression scheme by "terrible" didn't apply to
distribution (only installation). Also fixed the indentation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.484  2001/10/31 01:37:57  set<br>
<li> Synchronized home CVS with S.F.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.23  2001/11/02 21:17:28  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to 0.4.51-3.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.22  2001/10/29 18:40:35  terrible<br>
<li> Modified: added a '--comp-exe' switch to the configure script to force all
executables produced to be compressed with UPX, and now the default behaviour
is like before the modifications for the '--no-comp-exe' switch, in Unix the
editor is not compressed but infview is, the rationale is that it is more
common to have various editor instances than infview ones, and on other
architectures they are both compressed since there is not much performance
loss.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.21  2001/10/29 14:40:18  set<br>
<li> Added: --no-intl configuration option. Patch sent by jimmy@ncp.infonet.bg.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.20  2001/10/29 14:15:25  set<br>
<li> Synchronized S.F. CVS with changes made at home.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.19  2001/10/28 19:48:44  terrible<br>
<li> Added: --no-comp-exe option to configure script, to avoid compressing the
executables with UPX.<br>
<li> Modified: now default behaviour for all platforms is to compress
executables with UPX, previously on Unix the editor executable was not
compressed (only the infview was).<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to 0.4.51-2.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.483  2001/10/27 19:51:12  set<br>
<li> Added: ESC close the Message Window. Suggested by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.482  2001/10/27 19:41:56  set<br>
<li> Added: sLisp command progn, that's just an alias for eval. This is how
regular Lisp calls it. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: The last changes to the readme.1st.<br>
<li> Added: progn to the shl.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.481  2001/10/27 19:25:26  set<br>
<li> Added: The "Macro|Enter code to execute" gets the "macro under cursor"
to offer it as code to execute.<br>
<li> Added: When using it the returned value is displayed in the message
window. Thiago suggested something like it.<br>
<li> Added: A ~ operator to sLisp, it replaces the old not that now have a
more coherent meaning (is like ! in C). Thiago reported problems about it.
Documented.<br>
<li> Added: Hexadecimal shl to sLisp shl because that's supported.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now is possible to enter a negative integer in sLisp.<br>
<li> Fixed: After running a macro if it generated an error posterior runs
indicated the same error.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.480  2001/10/27 17:21:47  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The list of functions stores the name of the function and the line
number to jump. As the length of the name is arbitrary the line number
could be stored in memory missaligned. This is not a performance issue
because the process itself is complex but in SPARC machines generates a
SIGBUS.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.479  2001/10/27 17:16:35  set<br>
<li> Fixed: It looks like most systems include locale.h implicitly (with other
headers) but not Solaris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.478  2001/10/27 17:08:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView code assumed Linux is the only UNIX ;-). Seen on Solaris.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.477  2001/10/27 16:09:07  set<br>
<li> Added: An example on how to use an external filter with sLisp. The
example is for formating e-mails and was contributed by Grzegorz. (is in
the documentation).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.476  2001/10/27 15:11:10  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux/PPC and SPARC] For some bizarre reason gcc 2.95.2 is
generating references for the inline TCEditor::TurnOffHighLight() in all
the files that includes the TCEditor definition. This tries to pull the
ceditor.cc file where all data members are declared. This isn't a problem
for the editor but for InfView. So now the codepage.cc file doesn't
declare TCEditor if it isn't really needed (faster compilation ;-). I saw
it only on big endian platforms.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.475  2001/10/27 15:03:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When trying to use AM/PM clock and the system had a locale that
doesn't support it (i.e. LC_ALL=es) strftime doesn't put anything for the
%p value. It made the buffer of the desktop clock to have 1 character less
than expected and this character was random. I also enlarged the clock 1
character to make AM and PM visible and not just A and P. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.474  2001/10/25 00:29:41  set<br>
<li> Added: A user remind me that some special keyboard combinations (like
Alt+arrow keys) aren't detected when we use BIOS to extract keystrokes from
the queue. For this reason I explain it and how to revert to the old methode
in the readme.1st and windos.faq.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.473  2001/10/23 01:15:38  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Debian package distributes readme.1st compressed so the editor
failed to load it. Now the editor can also locate it. In the future I could
also distribute the file compressed in the tarball.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.472  2001/10/23 00:38:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The search tables used in editorfo.cc were allocated in one memory
chunk. This generates missaligment. This isn't critic in Intel platforms
(unless the OS explicitly enables a processor flag), but generates a kernel
warning log in Linux/PPC platforms and a SIGBUS in Linux/SPARC platforms.
As I was modifying it I did some more changes to make the code a little bit
compact.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.471  2001/10/22 23:45:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The KeyTNode structure had a union that contained a short and an
int value. As C seems to promote integers to int type gcc was choosing the
int member to store const unsigned short values (instead of the ushort
version of the union and in a static initialization) as a result of it the
value was wrongly stored in big endian platforms. Seen on PPC.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.470  2001/10/22 23:40:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The TInfViewer::draw() member uses a function called moveChar() it
was filling the buffer with character/attribute in an endian dependent
order. TV expects a fixed order no matters which endianess is used. Seen on
a Power PC machine (IBM RS/6000 at Source Forge).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.469  2001/10/22 23:29:24  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.468  2001/10/20 16:45:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] I forgot to put CONFIG_PREFIX in the BC++ 5.5 configuration
file.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32] BC++ 5.5 doesn't even define a dummy for chown, getuid and
getgid. I must move it to compatlayer but currently TV is in frozen.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.467  2001/10/20 15:12:33  set<br>
<li> Added: Acknowledge to VA Linux and S.F. crew, this service helped me to
get at least quite close to have support for other Linuxes and FreeBSD.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.466  2001/10/20 15:07:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: In loadcle and a member of the editor I assumed a char variable
can hold a negative value or at least the compiler is smart enough to
assume it means 0xFF. It isn't true for Power PC platforms. I changed it to
work with explicit unsigned chars.<br>
<li> Fixed: The edspecs module used a non-endian clean code when saving the
environment strings producing SIGSEGVs when loading the file in big endian
systems. Lamentably I think it there are more things like it. Seen in Power
PC.<br>
<li> Note: I compiled the editor for Alpha and PPC thanks to Source Forge's
Compiler Farm. The editor is corrupting the heap in Alpha and had those
problems in PPC. I'll test a fixed version but I really need some user on
these platforms to help me.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.465  2001/10/20 01:16:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Missleading information about Debian version in the policy.txt
file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.464  2001/10/20 01:16:04  set<br>
<li> Added: a fix to the configuration script to have it in sync with TV.<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor can detect makefiles just because they have
#!...make.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.463  2001/10/20 00:27:47  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [UNIX] some static functions in stackdbg.c weren't used in
non-intel platforms generating warnings (seen in Power PC).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.462  2001/10/20 00:22:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When using the editor SUID root and the ~/.setedit directory
wasn't yet created the editor created it as root because it didn't reach
the point where priviledges are droped. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.461  2001/10/20 00:17:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: I was casting pointers to integers in the keyboard tables code. It
doesn't work for the Alpha processor where sizeof(void *) == 8 and
sizeof(int) == 4 ;-) I knew it, but is sometimes I forget such a details.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.460  2001/10/20 00:10:15  set<br>
<li> Added: A new target "internac" to the makefile, it creates the *.mo
files.<br>
<li> Added: Anew target "doc-basic" to the makefile, it creates the txt and
info documentation.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the needed target includes internac and doc-basic. It
implies that "make editor" will also generate the i8n and doc files. It
avoids generating the files while using "make install" that needs root and
hence makes the files hard to delete. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] Now InfView's REMOVE_UNNEEDED only removes obsolete
files that belong to InfView. Thiago installed InfView 0.2.7 having setedit
0.4.41 and it deleted the help files of setedit.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.459  2001/10/19 23:26:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] It was unconditionally closing the opened windows even
if the command line indicated a .info file. It was introduced when I added
code pages support so it was present only in 0.2.7 beta. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.458  2001/10/19 22:52:38  set<br>
<li> Added: Ivan is maintaining a Debian repository for the editor and
InfView. I documented it in the readmes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.457  2001/10/18 23:52:07  set<br>
<li> Modified: I moved the changelog information generated before the use of CVS
to a new file called change0.log. I reformated it to be more like the current
change.log. The file contains 424 entries and ranges from 1996/12/03 to
1998/11/19, about 2 years.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.456  2001/10/17 23:38:16  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the configuration script informs if the configuration header was
changed.<br>
<li> Copied some fixes in conflib.pl from TV to make them in sync.<br>
<li> Fixed: a warning generated by gcc 2.8.1 about a variable that could be used
unitialized (wrong warning).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.455  2001/10/17 23:33:27  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.454  2001/10/14 22:27:26  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The detected CPU wasn't restored from the configure.cache
producing a wrong configuration header.<br>
<li> Fixed: SIGSEGV produced if we inserted text in a new buffer after a grep
search or errors collection.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.14  2001/10/14 06:44:45  terrible<br>
<li> Updated: Debian packaging to the "Let's see if I can release while I am
sleeping" release, version 0.4.50-1. See debian/changelog for details.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.453  2001/10/13 22:17:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: v0.4.50 needs TV 1.1.3 and the config.pl didn't enforce it.<br>
<li> Fixed: Global indent size wasn't stored in desktop files nor offered in
the default global options based on the shl. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: Accelerator for "Indent" (d) clashed with "To all" in the spanish
version. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Modified: version to 0.4.51.<p>

+<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.452  2001/10/12 02:50:38  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When opening the readme.1st the editor tried to make it read-only
but it didn't prevent the editor for issuing a warning if the file was
really read-only. Now the class takes isReadOnly as parameter in the
constructor.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] When using hidden desktop files and projects the editor
failed to load the desktop file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.451  2001/10/11 23:55:39  set<br>
<li> Updated the changes and fixes since 0.4.41 upto last revision.<p>

<li> Synchronized CVS with Source Forge.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.449  2001/10/09 22:37:54  set<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.448  2001/10/09 22:32:20  set<br>
<li> Added: Column markers. That's another edition option and can be used to
highlight columns. This is useful for languages that needs text in
particular columns (Fortran and Cobol I think). I tested global and local
settings and default global options. Documented. Suggested by Martijn
Versteegh.<br>
<li> Modified: version to 0.4.50.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.447  2001/10/09 17:56:52  set<br>
<li> Updated: Tcl/Tk syntax highlight. Patch by Philip Moore <FireEgl@EMail.com><br>
<li> Added: Fortran syntax highlight. Contributed by Martijn Versteegh
<versteegh@kvi.nl>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.446  2001/10/09 16:54:49  set<br>
<li> Tested the editor with PCRE 3.2, all works OK, I don't include it because
now uses autotools and fails to be configured for djgpp needing tricks.<br>
<li> Fixed the allegro 3.9.38 headers to compile with gcc 3.1, will send patches
to list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.445  2001/10/09 14:05:21  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Typo in C/C++ parser (#elif)<br>
<li> Bad news: The editor compiled with gcc 3.1 runs slower than compiled with
2.8.1 and is bigger: 11 % slower 20 % bigger. At least for my K6-2 CPU using<br>-O2 optimization. That's really bad.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.444  2001/10/08 22:09:33  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for gcc 3.1. The code compiled OK, but I was forced to
disable some part of Allegro's header :-(.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.443  2001/10/08 19:30:01  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for gcc 3.1 in the configuration scripts.<br>
<li> Added: Support for string streams in doedidia.cc (str streams doesn't exist
anymore).<br>
<li> Added: Support for "namespace" and "using" C++ keywords to the internal
syntax highlight.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.11  2001/10/07 23:46:19  terrible<br>
<li> Modified: updated Debian files to version 0.4.49-1.<br>
<li> Fixed: unnecesary compile of shipped libbzip2 because of typo in config.pl.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.442  2001/10/07 20:31:28  set<br>
<li> Added: a small script to create the .debs as a regular user
(debian/buildpackage).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.441  2001/10/07 19:30:37  set<br>
<li> Added: More mechanisms to make gettext work with the .po files. The main
problem is that old tools destroys the information needed for the new ones.
Now the scripts also updates version and revision time.<br>
<li> Fixed: When running suid root the stderr redirected files were owned by
root. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: When using a central dst file and loading another in a directory
the settings were transferred to the central one. Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.440  2001/10/07 14:30:57  set<br>
<li> Added: A command line option called --debug to the configuration script.
It selects switches that can be used for debug and testing purposes. They
are generic and could not match with the ones used to compile TV. Suggested
by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.439  2001/10/07 14:07:49  set<br>
<li> Added: Now if SET_FILES wasn't defined the editor also tries to guess
using the prefix indicated during configuration. I also added an option to
the configuration script to disabled it because I compile the editor in
e:/... for DOS and it could be the CD-ROM in some sytems producing a test
for the CD which is slow and annoying. Under UNIX I use /usr which is
already in the list to search, so my prefix isn't needed either.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.438  2001/10/06 23:15:01  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now is possible to set the number of closed windows to
something less than 3. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: Now ESC closes the man pages viewer. Suggested by Thiago.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.437  2001/10/06 22:42:34  set<br>
<li> Enhanced: Now the heuristic parser for C sources takes only one part of
#if #elsif #else #endif sequences when they are inside a function. It
solves a well known limitation. I hope it doesn't break all ;-) I did it
after a report by Grzegorz, the funny thing is that limitation was clearly
documented (RTFD).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.436  2001/10/06 19:58:10  set<br>
<li> Added: A couple of command to execute sLisp from the editor (selected
text) or entering it in an input line. Documented. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish traslation.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the Macros collection (list of sLisp macros defined by
user) holds a copy of the macro code. It makes possible to define macros
with the new mechanism without risking to lose them or leak memory.<br>
<li> Added: Support for commands with _ in their names to the meuload
mechanism. The new commands have it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.435  2001/10/06 17:22:41  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Calculator parsers aren't "locale aware" but libc is so it
generated a mess. Now the locale is set to C before running them. Reported
by Ivan.<br>
<li> Added: Some code to make the stackdbg module more robust when using
strong optimizations.<br>
<li> Modified: Debian release version used by the editor to -0.1 and not -1.<br>
<li> Fixed: SIGSEGVs when using the -b command line option.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.434  2001/10/06 16:04:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [sLisp] The RunProgramRedir command was forking and hence didn't
collect the external program output. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] A new optional parameter to RunProgramRedir. If provided
is used for the stdin of the external program. Documented. Suggested by
Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] MessageBox command to communicate things to the user.
Documented.<br>
<li> Added: [sLisp] An example of how to use the new RunProgramRedir to run an
external filter program. I tested it with "recode ISO8859-1..html".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.433  2001/10/06 14:27:58  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the files listed in the "no back-ups" list aren't remmebered
in the closed list. They are usually temporal files that won't exist
anymore. Documented.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.432  2001/10/06 14:16:43  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for "Jump to function" in assembler files. It takes the
labels excluding local gcc labels (they start with .). Documented.<br>
<li> Fixed: The syntax highlight for .s files didn't separate strings starting
with " and '.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.431  2001/10/06 13:30:49  set<br>
<li> Added: New option to open R.O. files as R.O. buffers.<br>
<li> Documented: New option "Open R.O. as R.O." plus all the new stuff in the
editor's general options.<br>
<li> Documented: Addition to menu: "Name current function"<br>
<li> Synchronized Source Forge CVS, tag sf0449_2.<p>

<b>Revision</b> 1.430  2001/10/05 00:38:47  set<br>
<li> Added: Name of current function to the menues. This command is old and is
available as an option of find & replace but wasn't in the menues.<br>
<li> Added: My CVS sync tools to the distribution list.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now when jumping to a file reported by an external program and the
file doesn't exist the editor doesn't open an empty window, it just ignores
it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.429  2001/10/05 00:07:31  set<br>
<li> Added: Comment about changes upto revision 1.386 of change.log to the
readme file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.428  2001/10/04 01:54:16  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for Allegro 3.9.x. It generates a bigger executable but
support more sound systems. It also generates a marginally bigger installer
(Not counting the editor increase). I provide a datafile replacement to avoid
pulling another 80 Kb or so.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.427  2001/10/02 00:51:23  set<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] If LFNs are supported and UNIX back-up style is selected
the editor appends the ~ at the end as in UNIX. I think it could fail for
remote file systems like Novell 3.12 ones but in this case the user should
simply avoid using it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.426  2001/10/02 00:32:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Documented that now Alt+F2 is not only for C. Also documented the
browse button.<br>
<li> Modified: The inf.h header included tv.h. It produced multiple inclusions
of a big header. Now you include infr.h and then settvuti.h (it includes
tv.h) finally you can include inf.h. In this way settvuti.h+tv.h and
related headers are included just once.<p>

<li> Removed: tcedit.dst file from CVS, it was there by accident.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.5  2001/10/01 02:51:07  terrible
Fixed: if we are not using shipped libbzip2 then use the system include files
and not the shipped ones.
Fixed: if we are not using shipped libbzip2, then not compile it.
New: support old libbzip2 (before 1.0 version).
Workaround: patchenv.pl checks if a variable needs replacing or not, the
problem is that it only checks in the first occurence of the variable (in
the .mak file), so if the first occurence of the variable not needed a
change, then it didn't change the other occurences even if they had to be
changed; so I have disabled that check and it always replaces the variables
no matter what, a Perl guru should elaborate a correct solution to avoid
changing everytime all the variables.
To do: Salvador has to check the various "FIXME:"'s and correct my mistakes
(though "It Works For Me TM" in Debian Potato and in Sid but maybe that's
because of black magic).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.4  2001/09/30 04:08:29  terrible
Updated Debian packaging to 0.4.47-2.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.3  2001/09/30 00:51:10  terrible
Debian packaging updated to 0.4.47-1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.2  2001/09/29 14:58:35  terrible
Updated Debian files to version 0.4.45-1.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.424  2001/09/30 20:46:51  set<br>
<li> Modified: The new tools.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.423  2001/09/30 20:03:05  set<br>
<li> Added: A experimental tool to synchronize my CVS with Source Forge's cvs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.422  2001/09/29 15:53:22  set<br>
<li> Many fixes to cleanly compile with gcc 3.0.1:<br>
<li> Modified: gcc 3 enforces /n at the end of files.<br>
<li> Fixed: Preprocessor expansion "]##." is deprecated.<br>
<li> Fixed: "#endif text" is deprecated.<br>
<li> Fixed: "condition ? object_type1 : object_type2" deprecated (casts
enforced).<br>
<li> Fixed: Multi-line strings deprecated. That's a real pity because they are
very convenient for inline assembler.<br>
<li> Fixed: Use of ios::bin (now CLY_IOSBin) in mp3list.cc.<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing memcpy prototype in mp3play.cc.<br>
<li> Modified: Now gcc doesn't provide set_new_handler() anymore.<br>
<li> Fixed: I put pathlist.h wrongly in the files list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.421  2001/09/26 02:37:31  set<br>
<li> Adapted: The es.po, de.po, utod.pl and Makefile for internationalizations
to work with gettext 0.10.39 tools (that seems to suppose files are in
UTF-8 by default!!). I hope the old tools I use in Linux won't mess the
whole thing.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.420  2001/09/26 02:05:23  set<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] Now in TV the keyboard is by default handled by BIOS.
Added command line switchs to revert it, documented and translated.
F*ck|ng gettext package, it is a real piece of shit, I'm sick of te really
stupid ideas incorporated to it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.419  2001/09/25 23:50:44  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the first time the editor forces to load the readme.1st it is
opened: 1) R.O. 2) Zoomed 3) With the cursor at the beginning.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.418  2001/09/23 23:37:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When running a program in background and it finished jumping to a
source line the result was quite confusing if we were in a modal dialog. In
this case the dialog remains with the keyboard focus but the select window
is another, most probably oculting the dialog. Now the run program
mechanism waits until we exit the dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.417  2001/09/23 23:16:26  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When match on the fly was enabled and also no wait the editor
failed to propagate some syntax highlight situations.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.416  2001/09/23 21:25:06  set<br>
<li> Updated: Calculator parsers that are and aren't compiled to compile with
the changes in compatlayer.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.415  2001/09/23 21:22:03  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The routine that restores a line under edition failed to update
the correct start of the selection when it purged spaces at the left of the
cursor position.<br>
<li> Fixed: The undo of BackSpace inserted spaces at the wrong column when
they were completly purged during the action.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.414  2001/09/23 20:11:34  set<br>
<li> Modified: Moved all the macros to define if we need \r\n or \n from
setedit to the compatlayer library.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.413  2001/09/23 15:46:52  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to indicate in which directories to search files we
indicate with Ctrl+Enter. Usually include dirs. Stored in the desktop file,
documented. Translated to spanish.<br>
<li> Modified: version to 0.4.49.<br>
<li> Modified: The algorithm that takes the name of a file under the cursor to
be smarter.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.412  2001/09/23 00:33:27  set<br>
<li> Fixed: After jumping to a function name extending the selection usually
generated strange results. It was like extending an old selection. Now the
selected line is made with a temporal selection like in the search
mechanism.<br>
<li> Fixed: When jumping to a function already in the screen it wasn't
highlighted.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.411  2001/09/22 23:53:20  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The C/C++ function parser failed with sequences like it: "\\\\".
Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: Alt+F7/F8 without hits gave a SIGSEGV (produced by the addition of
re-select the last if we passed it).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.410  2001/09/22 22:40:49  set<br>
<li> Added: A new command cmcInsertKeyName to insert the name of the key in
the text you are editing. Suggested by "Thiago F.G. Albuquerque"
<tfga@zaz.com.br>. Documented.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.409  2001/09/22 21:08:36  set<br>
<li> Modified: The TeX syntax highlight with some stuff contributed by Jan
Cnops <jan.cnops@hogent.be>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.408  2001/09/22 20:52:31  set<br>
<li> Updated: [InfView] readme to reflect last aditions.<br>
<li> Modified: [InfView] removed some unneeded code.<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] the "shell" menu option.<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] Internationalization files to the distro.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.407  2001/09/22 20:12:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] Now *all* the commands are enabled/disabled when an
InfView gets/lose the focus.<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] The man pages viewer.<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] Screen configuration. No more broken frames for systems
with ISO fonts! Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy> and Grzegorz Adam
Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com> were asking for it.<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] Internationalization for messages.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish translations.<br>
<li> Modified: [InfView] Moved the new window option to the file menu.<br>
<li> Added: Code page support to the ManPageView scroll bars.<br>
<li> Fixed: All ManPageView windows didn't remmember the position (just
centered every time).<br>
<li> Modified: edprefs.cc to use CLY_Packed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.406  2001/09/22 14:58:51  set<br>
<li> Updated: [InfView] versions and dates in manpage and info file.<br>
<li> Updated: [InfView] readme file, removed no longer pertinent stuff and
added the most relevant changes since last release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.405  2001/09/22 14:46:03  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor didn't store staticUseIndentSize and
staticDontPurgeSpaces in the desktop file. Reported by Martijn Versteegh.<br>
<li> Modified: version to 0.4.48.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.404  2001/09/22 14:41:44  set<br>
<li> Added: [InfView] Instructions about how to load info files stored in the
current directory. Suggested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] Now most commands are grayed when no window is available
reflecting the truth.<br>
<li> Modidied: [InfView] version to 0.2.7. It have various changes since 0.2.6
and nobody noticed it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.403  2001/09/22 02:20:47  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to disable the R.O. file warning. In this case the
editor will warn when you try to save so you have an oportunity to revert
it. Suggested by Marc-Antoine Massicotte <marc.massicotte@videotron.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.402  2001/09/21 02:25:19  set<br>
<li> Added: [DOS] More fixes to avoid collisions between conio.h and shipped
gettext.<br>
<li> Fixed: New standards seems to enforce a \n at the end of all sources. At
least gcc 3.0 says that. I added it to all the tests in the configuration
scripts.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] GCC 3.0 doesn't compile C++ code using the C compiler. The
configure script can detect it, but as it only happened with very old gcc
versions the scripts were looking for gxx and currently the C++ compiler is
inoked using gpp.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.401  2001/09/21 01:24:38  set<br>
<li> Modified: As now compatlayer defines uint* I needed to fix some
collisions.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.400  2001/09/20 01:45:21  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the configuration detects more details and defines
preprocessor variables acording to it. The definitions are also less
confusing. Now they are OS, OSf (subtype of OS), Comp (Compiler), Compf
(subtype of compiler) and CPU. With it I removed almost all magic __*__ tests
that are usually tricky and not so clear.<br>
<li> Added: Better prefix detection for MinGW.<br>
<li> Fixed: The version.txt file messed things if ended with \n, now is ok.<br>
<li> Added: Code to viewplus that I hope will reduce the problems when porting
to big endian systems. Related to the column/row cursor.<br>
<li> Fixed: The Perl parser didn't include numbers in function names.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.399  2001/09/16 22:38:45  set<br>
<li> Added: A test to put the distrib target in the Makefile only if the needed
tools are installed (zip for DOS and tar for UNIX).<br>
<li> Added: [DOS] Same for the installer target. The list of needed tools is
huge. This is a new target and creates the DOS installer.<br>
<li> Added: [DOS] Instructions if the user doesn't have fileutils installed.<br>
<li> Added: Configuration of ar for the gettext library.<br>
<li> Added: A new target (needed) for the Makefile. It compiles any thing needed
for the editor that isn't created by RHIDE projects.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] The shipped gettext assumed the user already patched your
djgpp installation as explained in the gettext 0.10.39 distribution. That's
impossible if the user never installed it. Now I tweaked the headers and code
to avoid collisions with conio gettext.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Some warnings from gcc 2.95.3 not detected by 2.95.2 for the
installer.cc file. Related to implicit conversions.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Some warnings from binutils 2.11.2 not reported by 2.8.1 in
mixsurf.c. Related to EOL C++ comments in inline assembler (must be in a
separated line).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.398  2001/09/16 20:10:00  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the clean target of the Makefile also cleans mpegsound
objects. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Applied some fixes for the Debian stuff sent by Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the scripts of distribution updates debian/changelog with my
name and stating it was a script. Sugested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.397  2001/09/16 17:29:21  set<br>
<li> Added: Architecture detection to the configure. It defines SECPU_$(Arch).<br>
<li> Added: GNU make detection to the configure. It supports gmake as name.<br>
<li> Added: GNU ar detection to the configure. It supports gar as name.<br>
<li> Fixed: In systems different than Linux and DOS RHIDE makefiles doesn't
include -lstdc++ (RHIDE_TYPED_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS).cc is not defined). So now
the configuration puts them as RHIDE_OS_LIBS. Seen on FreeBSD and Solaris.<br>
<li> Added: Support for ncurses installed as -lcurses (I saw it in Solaris).<br>
<li> Added: Now CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS can be passed to the configuration in the
command line (must use the perl script directly, no the shell script!). It
made the configset script usable with any UNIX shell (/bin/sh isn't bash in
a lot of UNIX systems).<br>
<li> Added: SunOS to the list of systems supported by the configuration. It
doesn't mean the library is working there.<br>
<li> Modified: References to __i386__ by SECPU_x86.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now gpm is detected and not assumed.<br>
<li> Fixed: The perl pmacros file made reference to an unexistant marker (@4).<br>
<li> Fixed: When specifying an out of range marker in pmacros a stack
corruption ocurred.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.396  2001/09/15 22:52:13  set<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] The compress script now deletes old manifest/version files
that could be left by an old version package in the directory where the
distribution is created.<br>
<li> Fixed: The arrangements in the order that main initializes things
affected the SET_FILES error report (made invisible).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.395  2001/09/15 21:56:37  set<br>
<li> Fixed: If none file was loaded with syntax highlight pressing Atl+F2
generated a SIGSEGV. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: Really simple parsers for .txi and .shl files. (For the Alt+F2).<br>
<li> Fixed: Some small details to get libset.a compiled.<br>
<li> Fixed: Is the editor remmembered a file that is read-only at start-up a
dialog pop-ups asking if we want to revert it, but it happends while the
editor is still loading files and the problem is that the idle() makes some
searchs in the list of opened windows. As it isn't completly loaded the
result was a SIGSEGV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.394  2001/09/15 19:28:45  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] Now by default the editor isn't distributed as a
compressed executable. According to Ivan it could make the kernel waste
memory.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.393  2001/09/15 19:21:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] all editor functions that collected word characters (like
ctrl+right/left arrows) wrongly stopped in accents. The problem was that it
didn't reflect the selected code page, just CP 437.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.392  2001/09/15 18:45:43  set<br>
<li> Added: EdReloadIfOpened to rhideint.cc to avoid unresolved references in
RHIDE. But I'm not sure if that's enough.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.391  2001/09/15 18:39:30  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When modifying files like ~/.setedit/deflopts.txt with the menues
and the file was opened by the editor the opened buffer got out of sync.
Now the editor checks if it was changed and then reloads the file. The same
applies to nobkp.txt and userword.txt files.<br>
<li> Fixed: It was possible to fool the editor and open the same file twice
if it was modified by an external program and saved with another i-node
value. As a result:<br>
<li> Modified: Now the editor checks if any of the opened files changed inode
before opening a new one. That's needed to avoid opening it twice.<br>
<li> Fixed: When collecting errors/messages the editor didn't check for names
like it: /dir/../dir/file and similar situations. In this case the editor
failed to find the information about this file in the project window. Now
the editor shows only the name of the file as the external program repoted,
internally adds the right path and ensures the name doesn't have such an
artifacts.<br>
<li> Modified: The way I hold the inode/dev is more abstract so other values
can be used. Currently Win32 target lacks inode information and it could
help. Also added a mechanism to reload a buffer without closing the window
and a more generic dialog that limits the lenght of file names.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.390  2001/09/14 02:09:15  set<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] Now also the er* files are created in ~/.setedit
[DOS] If the user defines a home directory they are stored there. Sugested
by Martijn Versteegh.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.389  2001/09/14 01:50:34  set<br>
<li> Modified: All the references to the web page to point to Source Forge,
also some e-mail references and the mailing list address.<br>
<li> Modified: The text of the readme files to better reflect the current
situation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.388  2001/09/12 03:01:34  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now when you jump to an error the editor puts in the status
line only the description of the error and not the entire line generated by
the compiler. That's very useful when you are in deep subdir and the file
name is quite large using most of the space. After all the file name is the
name of the window and the line is at the bottom of the window.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.387  2001/09/12 01:04:26  set<br>
<li> Added: A dialog to show where a file was stored. This dialog limits the
file name to around 90 characters showing only the last characters and
indicating with a ~ at the begining if the path was truncated.<br>
<li> Modified: Cleaned the pathtool interface a little bit now only two
functions should be used to load/save configuration files: ExpandHome and
ExpandHomeSave.<br>
<li> Modified: All modules to use the above mentioned functions.<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor tries to save configuration files modified by a
user to ~/.setedit/file. I did it to avoid polluting the home directory and
to put the default tcedit.dst in a place that nobody should run the editor.
The editor will load all files from ~/.file but will save them in the
directory. In this case (or when you load the original file from
/usr/share/setedit and now the editor is saving it in the home) the editor
informs the user with a dialog indicating where the file was stored.<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor failed to set the ShowMatchPairFly from the default
flags file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.1.1.1  2001/09/11 13:58:18  set
Imported sources.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.386  2001/09/09 22:16:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [BC++/Win32] Some unused parameter warnings.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Missing header in stackdbg.c (code I blindly wrote on Linux)<br>
<li> Fixed: Unreachable break detected by BC++.<br>
<li> Fixed: BC++ doesn't like default argument values in the function itself.<br>
<li> Fixed: Missing string.h in pperl.cc (gcc 2.95.2 doesn't report it for
internal functions).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.385  2001/09/09 20:31:58  set<br>
<li> Added: A tool to find the empty and fuzzy entries in a .po file. Is
called emptymsg. If you call it passing the names of the .po files to it
from the editor you'll get a list of missing/fuzzy entries that you can
browse using Alt+F7/F8. It combined with the special lines (it moves line
hits as text is added/deleted) and the .po SHL makes much more easy to
complete .po files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.384  2001/09/09 20:24:11  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option to avoid making backups for some particular files.
The setting is just a list of regex (Perl style) stored in a text file. If
a file name matches any of the regex the editor doesn't create a backup.
This option is only available in the standalone editor but is relative
easy to hook the needed stuff to the class (for RHIDE).<br>
<li> Added: The above mentioned option to the documentation. Also updated the
File Open options and mentioned the Options button. Documented the new
block case functions. Updated the list of SHLs supported.<br>
<li> Added: A new macro to the docs called @p{} to replace @paragraph{}, it
is much more convenient.<br>
<li> Added: A separated header file for loadshl.cc.<br>
<li> Updated: The spanish translation. Also generated the german file so any
user could complete it. I think 148 translations are missing or incorrect
(fuzzy filled) in the german file.<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] Now the editor loads ~/.file first that ~/file for any
configuration file. I did it because when saving the editor choose ~/.file
first.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.383  2001/09/09 00:26:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When I changed from absolute to relative projects the memory of
settings for project items got broken. It was long time ago but I didn't
realize it because it worked for projects where all files are in the same
directory and the closed windows also have memory. Now is fixed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.382  2001/09/08 23:29:25  set<br>
<li> Added: Block invert case and alternate case. I reused the code of block
toupper/lower and created those new funny functions.<br>
<li> Fixed: [UNIX] One of the new messages printed at exit didn't check if we
effectively redirected stderr trying to print a null pointer.<br>
<li> Modified: Now File Open dialogs not only remmembers paths+masks but also
file names (full qualified).<br>
<li> Fixed: When adding items to a project the only way to exit is by pressing
ESC, but then the editor didn't remmember the path we used and when
inserting again we must get it from the history. Now remmembers it.<br>
<li> Added: The number of lines of the saved text (not only size).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.381  2001/09/08 21:40:39  set<br>
<li> Added: Code page remap for a block of text (no the whole file). It have
undo and I reused code from toupper/lower block.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.380  2001/09/08 17:56:38  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The "backspace unindents" could get confused with lines containing
only spaces.<br>
<li> Fixed: The my_popen code used in stackdbg.c and the derivated used in
symify to close the right file handle and in the right order in the child
process. I noticed it looking how libc's popen is implemented.<br>
<li> Fixed: I completly rewrote the my_pclose function used in the above
mentioned sources because it created zombie process. I also made it more
robust. I must do some adjusts yet, but now works OK (is just slow).<br>
<li> Fixed: If argv[0] was just a file name (no relative path and no absolute
path) the code failed to detect if it had debug symbols.<br>
<li> Added: Credits to Bjorn and Grzegorz in the about dialog.<br>
<li> Added: A note about djgpp's implementation of putenv.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now child processes created by run a program are put in a
separated session and I kill the group. It is more effective when the child
creates other processes and one of them hangs. Killing the first child is
not enough, so now I kill the group. Note: it have an interesting side
effect that will introduce some changes soon, but is better.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.379  2001/09/08 00:16:36  set<br>
<li> Modified: [UNIX] Now when expanding compressed info files the temporal
file is removed just after opening it. Making it we don't let those
temporals when the editor crashes or we debug it. Is only enabled for UNIX.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.378  2001/09/07 23:48:53  set<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] Now the editor also dumps a stack trace when crashes. I
also added a message informing the user where the unsaved buffers and crash
information can be found.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] Two new behaviors in case of a crash. One calls gdb to
get a detailed stack trace and information about local variables the other
not only does it but also gives the control to gdb so we can get more
information. If we are in a X a separated xterm is created for gdb, that's
really cool! I based it in code by Bjorn Reese <breese@mail1.stofanet.dk>
that Grzegorz sent me.<br>
<li> Added: A command line switch to select the behavior of the editor in case
of a crash. It supersedes the --no-signal option. Also sorted the command
line options. The name is --stack-dbg (d).<br>
<li> Added: An environment variable to set the default behavior of -d option.<br>
<li> Updated: man page to reflect the new command line. Also added two
environment variables (the new one and other) and sorted the options
alphabetically.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] A tool equivalent to djgpp's symify to process stack
traces. (tools/symify.cc).<br>
<li> Fixed: After adding some routines to edspecs.cc InfView gave undefined
references, so I added a dummy to avoid it.<br>
<li> Updated: Spanish messages.<br>
<li> Fixed: I was damaging argv[0]. It was easy to see when running ps, the
editor name had a space after the last slash.<br>
<li> Added: A small script to install the editor without stripping debug
information. It will allow me to start gdb each time the editor crashes on
my system. I also added the needed code to the makefile and installation
scripts.<br>
<li> Modified: Now I call TEventQueue::suspend() from the signal handler
instead of suspend_keyboard(). I know that's more dangerous but uses a
standard mechanism.<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor also prints the signal number in the error file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.377  2001/09/05 19:19:08  set<br>
<li> Modified: More details in the routines that closes undesired editors.
Damn is really tricky.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.376  2001/09/05 17:45:27  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option to the Run program options dialog. When enabled and
we get errors from the child process the editor jumps to the first line
with errors (like in RHIDE).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.375  2001/09/05 17:19:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When enabling the column cursor in a window that wasn't restored
from disk it sometimes was shorter than what we expect. It was due to a
wrong initialization of CrossCursorCol member, the same could happend with
the row cursor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.374  2001/09/05 16:55:48  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now I extended the option to forget the cursor position to also
forget about other settings remmembered for closed and project files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.373  2001/09/05 16:45:59  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the "Open only specified files" option is divided in various
options to give more control about what is stored in the desktop file. Now
the windows are divided in three types: Editor, Non editors and Closed
Editors. For each group is possible to set if we want to: remmember it,
remmember it but if the command line contains file names forget or just
don't remmember. These nine options replaces the old one. I added it
because some users didn't like the current behavior and wanted a
differerent behavior to the one that Ivan sugested when I added it. In
particular Tatu || Vantte Kilappa <elfire@kymp.net> wanted a middle ground
behavior.<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.47. So we can adapt the old setting and select
three of the new ones that are equivalent.<br>
<li> Added: An option to not remmember the cursor position while loading the
desktop.<br>
<li> Modified: The edpecs.cc calls. Now it have a separated header and some
functions that are commonly used. It makes the code more compact and
readable.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.372  2001/09/05 01:43:28  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The option to open only the editor indicated in command line was
broken.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.371  2001/09/04 19:54:40  set<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for "Cascading Style Sheets v2" contributed by
S. M. Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for "JavaScript" contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for "PostScript" contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.<br>
<li> Added: More tags to the HTML syntax highlight contributed by S. M.
Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.370  2001/09/04 19:27:19  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Win32+BC++] Inserted call to EmptyClipboard in the function that
sets data in the windows clipboard. Without this call data set by editor
was not seen by other application.  It happened because we did not set
editor as the clipboard owner. Call to EmptyClipboard does this. It only
applies to Win32 target, patch from Anatoli Soltan <anatoli@iname.com>.<br>
<li> Modified: The behavior of Paste from Win Clipboard to be consistent with
what a regular windows user would expect.  Now it just does not copy the
previous selection to the clipboard and selects the pasted text only if
persistent blocks are enabled. Patch from Anatoli Soltan
<anatoli@iname.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.369  2001/09/04 18:04:04  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the default color for reserved words is light blue over
blue and not green over blue.<br>
<li> Fixed: It was impossible to use CFLAGS options that contained
option=value because it confused patchenv.pl failing to configure the
makefiles. Reported by Norberto Alfredo Bensa <nbensa@hotmail.com><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.368  2001/09/04 03:49:23  set<br>
<li> Added: The TColorSelector::mark to the codepage remapper. It wasn't
available before.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.367  2001/09/04 00:16:18  set<br>
<li> Added: A new color in the palette for the disabled clusters. Also added
to the load process that if the palette we are loading doesn't have this
color it is initialized to a default. So:<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.46.<br>
<li> Added: Now we can specify that one of the error parsers defined in the
errors.cle file is the internal one. It should be used to use the internal
GNU parser instead of the defined in the file. Why? is much more faster and
supports internationalization.<br>
<li> Modified: Syntax Highlight file to reflect it.<br>
<li> Modified: Copyright dates in readme files and about dialogs.<br>
<li> Added: A button to the file open/save/etc dialog to configure the sorting
options.<br>
<li> Added: The new options to hide .*/*~/*.bkp and sort .* to the end to the
dialog to configure the file open dialog.<br>
<li> Fixed: The above mentioned dialog was broken when I created the 32 bits
clusters and generated SIGSEGVs.<br>
<li> Fixed: The patch I did to avoid crashes when no CLE files were available
disabled the other parsers.<br>
<li> Fixed: The generic error parsers some times added an extra / generating
file names with to consecutive / (invalid for UNIX).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.366  2001/09/03 17:44:10  set<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for the new Run Program options.<br>
<li> Modified: Now words in italic are represented enclosed by `' in the text
and info outputs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.365  2001/09/02 00:33:59  set<br>
<li> Fixed: If no default options file was defined the default mask used to
reset modes was just 16 bits and not 32 clearing "Use indent size",
"Don't purge spaces" and "Backspace unindents". So they failed to be
transfered from global to local options.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.364  2001/09/02 00:07:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] A bug in the use of putenv, it made the editor fail to
detect the /tmp dir. As a result the editor created temporal files in the
current directory.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.363  2001/09/01 23:25:36  set<br>
<li> Added: A warning message if when the user tries to exit the child still
running or we still parsing the errors. If the user wants to exit anyways
the editor first stops it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.362  2001/09/01 23:03:55  set<br>
<li> Added: Status line shortcuts for the Message Window (in the 3 menu files
and in editmenu.cc).<br>
<li> Fixed: Now Prev/Next message are enabled only if the Message Window
really have lines to jump to.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] The run external program option now can run the program
in background. It can optionally disabled by the user.<br>
<li> Added: The background process can be stopped just selecting the Message
Window and pressing Ctrl+C. The status line indicates if that's available
or not (the process is running or we still parsing their output).<br>
<li> Added: Now the messages/errors from the external program can be parsed
in background. Is slower but you can continue working. That's the default
when the command runs in parallel, but can be enabled even if the process
will block the editor.<br>
<li> Added: Options to configure how often the Message Window is updated when
the messages are parsed in parallel with the child program (the parameter
is how many lines are processed before releasing the CPU to poll input
devices). Also to configure if the window is forced to scroll or not.<br>
<li> Updated: The spanish translation.<br>
<li> Fixed: The new bufun.cc option to browse the functions didn't update the
special lines arrays.<br>
<li> Modified: The interface to show messages in the Message Window to add all
of this gadgets. I wrote an equivalent in rhideint.cc I hope it won't break
RHIDE.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the Message Window only scrolls to the first line only if we
collected lines to jump. It was the original idea but was wrongly
implemented.<br>
<li> Added: Dialogs to avoid the user running a second child process in:
Run External Program, SDG and Grep. Sure I missed something ;-)<br>
<li> Fixed: Internationalized some messages I forgot while coding.<br>
<li> Modified: Now is possible to enter comands upto 256 characters long in
the run external program dialog (was 80).<br>
<li> Fixed: When running `make' as the external program the editor keeps track
of the various directory changes that makes does (nested makefiles). That's
needed for programs that reports errors giving relative names. The problem
was that when using spanish messages the editor got confused. Now the
editor tries with english and if it fails tries translating it. Currently
only english and spanish are supported but that's done with the .mo file
so any language can be supported without recompiling.<br>
<li> Fixed: The GNU errors parsed was fulled by some gcc messages like it:
In file included by .....:line:\n
Now those lines are discarded.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.361  2001/08/31 19:32:09  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now if the terminal have a fixed code page that we know and
can't be changed then the editor disables the recoding mechanism. That's
true for terminals like xterm (enhanced VT100).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.360  2001/08/31 19:30:01  set<br>
<li> Added: Perl function parser to the bufun.cc mechanism. Also added more
information to the bufun.h file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.359  2001/08/29 23:41:50  set<br>
<li> Added: A shell option to the Linux version. I ever thinked it wasn't a
good idea but a user asked for it. Sugested by David Xu
<davidx@viasoft.com.cn>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.358  2001/08/29 20:31:25  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now when a file that was stored in the desktop file no longer
exists the editor doesn't open an empty window. Sugested by Martijn
Versteegh <m.versteegh@hccnet.nl><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.357  2001/08/29 16:39:42  set<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to specify the Turbo Vision library and includes
path as parameters for the configuration script. That's useful for systems
with prefixes like /opt. Sugested by Joel Soete <joel.soete@freebel.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.356  2001/08/29 00:40:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When jumping to another manpage double clicking the name of the
new one the window didn't update their title.<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug introduce in the last changes to the manpage viewer. I was
releasing twice the name of the temporary stderr file (because librhtv
deletes it internally).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.355  2001/08/28 18:37:24  set<br>
<li> Added: Sources of gettext 0.10.39 configured to avoid libiconv. They are
intended for DOS users that doesn't have gettext installed or want to get a
much smaller executable (like me). I decided it after a discussion in the
djgpp-workers list, even the DOS porter of gettext Juan Manuel Guerrero
<st001906@hrz1.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de> sugested it for the editor's case.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.354  2001/08/28 14:32:16  set<br>
<li> Added: Support for gettext 0.10.37 and newer that needs libiconv. I tested
it with 0.10.39 and 1.7. Even when that's supported the result is quite bad,
for the DOS target the binary grows 829 Kb and when compressed 614 Kb. That's
unacceptable. The size of the compressed editor is currently about 480 Kb and
grows to 1094 Kb.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.353  2001/08/27 20:37:06  set<br>
<li> Modified: Removed the bufun.h inclusion in ced_exte.h to reduce
dependencies.<br>
<li> Fixed: If the errors.cle file wasn't there the editor crashed when you run
external programs. Reported by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.352  2001/08/27 19:37:44  set<br>
<li> Modified: I moved all the bufun.cc definitions to an independent header
called bufun.h. Also renamed the buffers and exported them so other parsers
can reuse it.<br>
<li> Added: Now the Clipper parser detects the last line of functions and also
adds information to the name indicating if the function is a procedure and
if the static qualifier was used.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.351  2001/08/26 00:36:52  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the jump to function mechanism (bufun.cc) can support languages
other than C/C++. I added Clipper support and Grzegorz is working on a LaTex
parser.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.350  2001/08/16 01:28:18  set<br>
<li> Added: A patch to avoid problems when including ced_clas.h twice. From
Robert.<br>
<li> Fixed: A problem in the libset library used by RHIDE. Now rhideint.cc
must provide EdJumpToMessage(), currently is just a dummy.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.349  2001/08/14 22:56:21  set<br>
<li> Added: A comment about buggy GeForce BIOSes in the Win/DOS FAQ. They seems
to have similar bugs to Matrox BIOSes. Thanks to Andy <Bitland@aol.com>.<br>
<li> Added: A button to the function list called "Browse". It sends the list of
functions to the message window sorted alphabetically or by line number and
then you can browse the source code jumping from function to function.
Sugested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>.
It added a new parameter to SelectFunctionToJump.<br>
<li> Added: Now when the user have one central desktop file the editor makes a
back-up of it before writing a new one. This is quite useful for Windows
systems that likes to crash and corrupt files. Sugested by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.348  2001/08/14 17:51:12  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView's search dialog was broken due to aligment in the
TFindInfDialogRec structure. Now is marked with pack(1) to avoid it, I guess
that's something new with gcc 2.95.x.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.347  2001/08/14 00:56:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] When a manpage didn't exist Linux's man outputs to stderr
a message. In the past the editor missed it giving no help to the user and
also letting an error file in the home directory. Now stderr is also
redirected and if stdout is empty stderr is shown. Reported by
"GiBa" <giba@lacasilla.com.ar>.<br>
<li> Fixed: utod.pl again.<br>
<li> Modified: The makefile so makes/linux/compress.pl doesn't need to be
executable (CVS likes to forget it because my CVS in a fat32 partition).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.346  2001/08/13 23:16:50  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug in "Intelligent C indent". A parenthesis after a / was not
counted leading to wrong indentation. I hope the new code really fixed it
without breaking other detail.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.345  2001/08/13 22:38:37  set<br>
<li> Modified: To make recode happy now the CP850 files are ever converted to
DOS format (not only in Linux). I made utod.pl more reliable too.<br>
<li> Added: SHL for .po files.<br>
<li> Added: German translations, thanks to Oliver Schieche
<oliver.schieche@d2mail.de>. Also added it to the Linux and DOS distribution
and to the installer (was tricky).<br>
<li> Added: All the Turbo Vision messages to the translations, so I updated the
spanish translation.<br>
<li> Fixed: The message window scrolled horizontally only 255 columns and lines
are allowed to be 1000 columns (then are wrapped). So now you can fully
scroll upto 1000 columns.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.344  2001/08/13 18:13:21  set<br>
<li> Added: Preload to C/C++, Perl and Makefile SHLs.<br>
<li> Added: Objetive C and PDP 11 assembler SHLs contributed by Beni Cherniavsky
<cben@crosswinds.net>.<br>
<li> Added: Preload keyword to the .shl SHL.<br>
<li> Added: The Emacs mode for .frt files as "sdg", also added to a couple of
.frt files because they generate files with "texinfo" markers confusing the
editor.<br>
<li> Added: link and mailto commands to the html.frt as sugested by Florian
Xaver.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.343  2001/08/13 17:30:24  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the keywords of the syntax highlights aren't loaded at
start-up, intead they are loaded on demand. The keywords and the search
tables are the most memory consuming parts of the syntax highlight structure.<br>
<li> Added: A Preload keyword to force the most commonly used SHL keywords to be
loaded at start-up.<br>
<li> Fixed: Added to the distribution a file I forgot in the upload of the last
beta.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.342  2001/08/12 17:50:39  set<br>
<li> Compiled with BC++ 5.5:<br>
<li> Added: A comment in BC++ 5.5 port making explicit where should be TV
located.<br>
<li> Fixed: A use of variable size array in ceditor.cc (AllocLocalStr now)
(Win32).<br>
<li> Fixed: Use of strcasecmp without Uses_string (Win32).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.341  2001/08/12 16:07:46  set<br>
<li> Merged patches from Andris addressing compiling issues when using gcc 2.97
and newer releases:
1) #endif at the end of files must have a new line character at the end.
2) strlen and other internal functions now needs #include <string.h>
3) The need for ## concatenation in macros is no longer needed when symbols
are around the variable and now is deprecated. I left the old code (disabled)
just in case it breaks very old gcc releases so we can just make it
conditional.
4) Is no longer valid to cast a pointer to a smaller integer, so now two
consecutive casts are needed, one to convert the pointer into an integer and
another to cut down the integer. This is used in the keyboard routines where
collections uses void * to store 16 bits unsigned values.<br>
<li> Added: Support for ".inf.gz" extension (from Andris patch)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.340  2001/08/11 01:40:17  set<br>
<li> Added: CommentIndent command, it indents a block with the EOLCom1
definition. Sugested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Added: CommentUnIndent, it unindents a block using the length of EOLCom1 as
reference. Sugested by Thiago.<br>
<li> Fixed: UnIndentBlock failed to update the syntax highlight, it was clear
after removing the comments in the block.<br>
<li> Fixed: The undo of the arbitrary indent used the starting selection instead
of the final one generating problems for long blocks.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.339  2001/08/10 02:50:36  set<br>
<li> Added: sLisp commands:
  OpenFile: opens a file as a new window. (Asked by "Thiago F.G. Albuquerque"
            <tfga@zaz.com.br>)
  length: returns the length of a string.
  strcasecmp/strcmp: compares strings.
  Operator -: for integers.<br>
<li> Added: these new commands to the syntax highlight and documentation (also
strstr).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.338  2001/08/05 23:35:46  set<br>
<li> Modified: The way the PREFIX is passed to the compress scripts to allow
the main makefile to generate the distribution. It should be reworked.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.337  2001/08/04 23:41:01  set<br>
<li> Added: New configuration option to avoid using FHS structure and set it
for my configuration.<br>
<li> Added: Distribution targets to the main makefile they pass the FHS
options to the makes/Makefile.<br>
<li> Modified: The way the es_iso.po file is created to avoid stupid problems
from recode. The recode and gettext are generating problems all the time.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.336  2000/12/09 21:32:42  set<br>
<li> Merged changes from Anatoli for the BC++ configuration process. Also makes
pmacros files support DOS format in UNIX.<br>
<li> Added: Comments in the FAQ about Cirrus boards that have problems under W9x<br>
<li> Updated: the WinNT/readme.txt file to reflect the actual process.<br>
<li> Fixed: The 'D' shortcut was used twice in the redmond.smn for the File
menu. Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Added: A dialog asking if a compressed file saved with "save as" should be
also saved compressed. Reported by Gregorio.<br>
<li> Added: A TODO file.<br>
<li> Fixed: More conflicts between gettext and conio.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now when closing a project the window title (of the application)
reverts to "No project loaded". Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Fixed: Compilation problems when PCRE wasn't available.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.335  2000/08/09 23:30:23  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor didn't preserve the UID/GID of files when creating
back-ups.<br>
<li> Fixed: When loading some old desktop files with black palettes (created by
some really old versions of the editor) you got a black screen. Now the editor
checks for such a silly situation and reverts to the default palette.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.334  2000/06/27 02:37:03  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now using gettext 0.10.35.<br>
<li> Modified: Now using RHIDE 1.4.7.6.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.333  2000/06/27 01:16:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some pmacros needed "back space unindents" *NHP*.<br>
<li> Modified: Now using bzip2 v1.0, it is supposed to be more bullet-proof when
uncompressing garbage. Thanks god I included it directly because the
function names changed from 0.x to 1.0 (added BZ2_ prefix).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.332  2000/06/13 23:36:49  set<br>
<li> Added: Warning about Creative PCI boards not supported by Allegro.<br>
<li> Modified: TMixDiag constructor to avoid calling gettext inlined because
gcc 2.95.2 doesn't like it. I suspect that's a bug in gcc because 2.7.x and
2.8.x doesn't reject it.<br>
<li> Added: A desktop lock while parsing the errors output from external
programs to reduce the redraw. Linux's frame buffer is poorly implemented and
have a really bad performance producing amazingly huge delays. Reported by
Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.331  2000/06/06 00:49:03  set<br>
<li> Added: A check and warning for/by makeinfo during configuration.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.330  2000/06/06 00:41:40  set<br>
<li> Added: A check for xgettext in the configuration script and a warning if
recode isn't installed.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.329  2000/06/06 00:19:36  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the configure tells if recode wasn't found.<br>
<li> Fixed: Warning in menuload.cc with gcc 2.7.2.3.<br>
<li> Ignored doc/Makefile in the CVS.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.328  2000/06/04 18:37:36  set<br>
<li> Added: Now all modes are supported in the Mode setence used by the pmacros.<br>
<li> Added: Now the $if command supports and/or operators for menu files.<br>
<li> Added: The MP3 list can be loaded/saved as a WinAmp M3U list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.327  2000/05/25 19:12:56  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to configure the BC++ port to generate a dynamic/static
executable.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now when passing a list of files to grep the filenames are quoted to
avoid problems with file names containing spaces. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Modified: The check to see if grep is installed. It now checks for GNU grep
to avoid problems with other implementations. In particular Inprise version
that is quite far from POSIX.<br>
<li> Warning: I discovered that BC++ and MingW libraries have a really buggy
system function, it can just crash Windows 95 misserably when passing long
command lines, lets say 3.5 Kb. It can affect the editor stability.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.326  2000/05/25 15:21:33  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the configure mechanism generates the BC++ makefiles. With it
all the targets now uses the information found in the .gpr files to compile.
It means I just need to keep updated the list of files to include in the
distribution, all the other makefiles are generated from RHIDE's projects
(djgpp/Linux/Win32 directly and BC++ indirectly).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.325  2000/05/22 23:49:30  set<br>
<li> New: Now the MingW port uses the same makefiles than the DOS and Linux
targets. It means this port will be quite updated without taking special
care.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the configure script doesn't overwrite the configed.h file if
it wasn't changed. That's good to avoid a masive recompile when it isn't in
fact needed.<br>
<li> Updated: The configuration library with changes in the TV version of it.<br>
<li> Added: A mechanism to change more variables in RHIDE makefiles from the
configure script.<br>
<li> Fixed: EasyDiag's TSTextScroller size.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the about box have a TSTextScroller because I added thanks to
Vadim and Anatoli.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.324  2000/05/20 13:19:03  set<br>
<li> New: Now thanks to changes from Anatoli Soltan merged in TV the exe
generated with BC++ runs under Win95 and NT.<br>
<li> Added: Configuration mechanism to support the new syntax of recode 3.5. It
also allows to make the editor in machines without recode.<br>
<li> Added: Code to the configuration library to generate makefiles from
templates of makefiles doing some search & replace.<br>
<li> Merged small changes from Anantoli Soltan to the BC++ makefiles. They allow
creating the help file (makeinfo for Win32 is shipped) and installing the
compiled files.<br>
<li> Added: A couple of new pmacros to Clipper.<br>
<li> Fixed: The BC++ errors parsing definition (errors.cle).<br>
<li> Fixed: A table in the manual (strftime options).<br>
<li> Fixed: Now sdh.c uses getcwd (no getwd) because (a) getwd is deprecated (I
saw it in Linux and Oswald Buddenhagen <ob6@inf.tu-dresden.de> asked to fix
it) and (b) getwd doesn't exist for BC++ so Anatoli sent patches to replace
it. Now the compatlayer is used for it.<br>
<li> Fixed: The generation of .html files from the .txt ones. Now < and > are
replaced. Reported by Neil Parks <nparks@torah.org>.<br>
<li> Fixed: When following a list of errors/hits with Alt+F8 in some cases the
previous hit wasn't cleared.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.323  2000/05/17 23:09:36  set<br>
<li> Modified: Some details in EasyDiag: OK+Cancel buttons to work in growable
dialogs and xTSRight,xTSLeft and xTSLeftOf calculations (hope nothing got
screwed).<br>
<li> Modified: Now the list of functions lists members like this "member
(class)" instead of C++ syntax "class::member". It makes the incremental
search much more simple.<br>
<li> Modified: The list of functions and list of windows now have horizontal
scroll bar. Also: they are EasyDiag dialogs now.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.322  2000/05/16 02:10:23  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A crash when deleting all the items (and one more ;-) in the MP3
list. Only happend if you did it very quickly.<br>
<li> Added: An horizontal scroll bar to the MP3 list dialog.<br>
<li> Added: Now easydiag list boxes can have two scroll bars. I modified TV a
little bit to make it easier.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.321  2000/05/16 00:17:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The error pattern description for Borland C compilers. Now it works
for BC++ 5.5. Grzegorz reported problems and I fixed it.<br>
<li> Added: clear keyword to the HTML syntax. Suggested by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Fixed: The syntax hl for shell scripts needed EscapeAnywhere=1. Reported by
Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: SQL syntax. Contributed by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor added read-only copies to the list of closed windows when
closing one of them. It produced a crash when opening the file from the
closed list. Reported by Volker Kiefel"<volker.kiefel@med.uni-rostock.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.320  2000/05/15 01:00:28  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Palette support to the Linux version. Also changed the palette
values to be 0-255 instead of 0-63 to be more generic. Lamentably it looks
like Linux people forgot to add a get palette sequence, is that correct? if
all half done?<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.319  2000/05/13 19:58:38  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option that forces the editor to do the match pair 'on the
fly' without waiting for idle. Suggested by Oswald Buddenhagen
<ob6@inf.tu-dresden.de>.<br>
<li> Modified: Now backspace behavior is not tied to the Real Tabs option. It
have your own option. It was suggested by others in the past but Oswald
finally made me do it ;-)<br>
<li> Updated: The documentation to reflect all the new modes.<br>
<li> Modified: accehtml.cc line 31 to workaround a bug in egcs (doesn't like
calls to static members specifying an object!).<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if you have two functions with the same name SDG will list both
in the index. Reported by Gregorio.<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.45.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.318  2000/05/12 23:16:40  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: The configure script was looking for the dinamic TV when static was
specified.<br>
<li> Fixed: infbase.cc request of filelength.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.317  2000/05/12 02:19:46  set<br>
<li> Incorporated the Win9x and WinNT versions. The WinNT version was introduced
thanks to Anatoli Soltan <anatoli@iname.com> and is for BC++ 5.5 compiler.<br>
<li> Moved some stuff to a new library (part of TV now) and will move even more
things. The idea is to avoid an excess of conditionals. This introduced
changes in almost all sources.<br>
<li> Adapted to compile with MingW32 for Win32.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.316  2000/04/29 17:55:05  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: Gave 2 more rows for the mixer sliders.<br>
<li> Modified: Added more description to the mixer name.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.315  2000/04/29 17:04:55  set<br>
<li> Added: Board level sound mixer. As this is something I want and not all the
people seems to agree that this is desirable I added options to: (a) disable
it at compilation time (HAVE_MIXER and --without-mixer) and (b) a run time
option (command line --no-mixer). Under DOS only SB Pro and SB 16 compatible
mixers are supported. Under Linux OSS mixer is supported. The values can be
optionally stored in the desktop file.<br>
<li> Changed: I synchronized the configuration library with the one used by TV.<br>
<li> Added: A new EasyDiag object called TSSlider. Is used for the volume
settings in the mixer's dialog.<br>
<li> Fixed: A GPF when the editor was stopped during a list play operation and
it was restored in another run.<br>
<li> Fixed: A small detail in mpegsound from 0.8.3 new version.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.314  2000/04/20 19:16:19  set<br>
<li> Added: </li keyword to HTML syntax. Suggested by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: A new option: Don't purge spaces. When enabled the spaces at the end
of lines aren't automafically deleted by the editor. Suggested by Martijn
Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>, wasn't the first user.<br>
<li> Added: Warning about bugs in xgettext in the makefile.<br>
<li> Updated: The spanish traslation.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.313  2000/04/16 20:17:03  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: MP3 support to the Linux version.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.312  2000/04/16 18:23:34  set<br>
<li> Added: A new library for MP3 files. That's the library used by Linux's
splay. I added support for MP3s inside wavs, damaged MP3 files, VBR encoded
files and more to this code. Users should consider it under test.<br>
<li> Added: The mpegsound library to the configuration process. I keep libamp
and is possible to choose between the two engines.<br>
<li> Fixed: The use of 2 sets of flags in the .mak files (one from the
RHIDE_OS_FLAGS and the other from CFLAGS).<br>
<li> Added: A set of C/C++ flags for parts of the project that needs strong
optimization, like the MP3 engines.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some problems with the version of the information stored for closed
files. It wasn't present in releases, just in WIP versions.<br>
<li> Fixed: Bug in relative paths interpretation of the code that parses
messages from external programs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.311  2000/04/13 00:37:46  root (set)<br>
<li> Updated: .gpr file and sources for the new TV dependencies (tv/...).<br>
<li> Updated: version.txt file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.310  2000/02/27 20:14:19  set<br>
<li> Added: Now tab size, indent size and wrap column are stored for closed
files and project items.<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView now doesn't hang if the node can't be found.<br>
<li> Added: InfView now looks in all the file if the node isn't found in the
first try. It helps for handedited/damaged info files I saw it in files that
David Cabanillas Barbacil <davidc@ibernet.com> sent me (GPC help files).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.309  2000/02/27 18:52:13  set<br>
<li> Added: Yet another tab option: Now is possible to indent using spaces but
also using an indentation ammount different than the tab size. The new option
is called "Use indent size" and you can also configure the value of "indent
size". In this way is possible to code like Allegro's guidelines say:
"Basic Allegro style: K&R, with 3 space indentation. On disk, though, tab
stops are 8 spaces, so if for example a line was indented by 12 spaces, this
would be saved out as either 12 space characters or 1 tab and 4 spaces, not
as 4 tabs.". It was proposed by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.<br>
<li> Modified: As a result of these new settings now we have 17 global flags, it
overflowed the traditional TV limit of 16 bits. To overcome it I added a 32
bits version of radio buttons and check boxes to TV. It isn't the final
solution because I think these dialogs really need a new layout. Anyways, as
I think 32 bits is more suitable for gcc now the editor uses 32 bits options
in all places. To achieve it I was forced to modify a lot of structures and
dialogs. Tested most of them, I hope no bugs were introduced.<br>
<li> Modified: As a result of this I did a cleaning job in the editor dialogs. I
added some EasyDiag goodies: a new TSViewCol constructor that creates a
default dialog (that's the most common case), a variation of doIt that sets
the dialog as centered and configures the help context (doItCentered), a new
positioning option yTSUpSep it puts the object on top of the dialog but
letting some space between the frame and the object and multicolumn radio
buttons and check boxes. Now EasyDiag also defaults to 32 bits options, it
can be disabled defining Dont_Use_32Bits_Clusters. I also added a callback to
TV buttons and modified TSButton to reflect it. yTSUp was fixed.<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.43.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.308  2000/02/24 23:10:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Applied some patches from Alex Lozano for EasyDiag. They fix
problems with xTSLeft and yTSOver (I don't usually use them). I applied one
of the patches with a small variant.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.307  2000/02/23 00:31:22  set<br>
<li> Added: A new option in Search & Replace, it shows the name of the function
where the match was found (only for C/C++ and if the match is inside).
Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.42 (change in S&R flags).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.306  2000/02/22 01:25:57  set<br>
<li> Added: A new command called cmcWhichFunctionIs. It determines the name of
the function where the cursor is positioned. It isn't the fastest thing in
the world because it collects the list of all functions, but as bufun.cc is
really fast I think that's ok. It isn't associated to a key. I also commented
how the magic heuristic of bufun.cc works. This addition is the first step
to create a mechanism suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.305  2000/02/22 00:12:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When using the match pair on the fly the editor always forced a line
flush even if the cursor weren't in a potential match. Now that's done only
if the cursor is over {, }, (, ), [ or ]. A side effect of this behavior was
reported as a bug by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.304  2000/02/21 23:57:39  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When loading .dst files older than 0.4.32 the memorized flags for
closed files were converted in the wrong way. Some times enabling the cross
cursor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.303  2000/02/21 23:21:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Small typos in new documentation.<br>
<li> Fixed: Uninitialized data in the cross cursor stuff that could generate
GPFs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.302  2000/02/13 21:48:02  set<br>
<li> Added: a new command (LineOrScrEnd), that's 100% equivalent to VI's g-end.
The previously added (LastColInScreen) isn't 100% equal. The new one doesn't
go to the last column of the screen if the end of line is first. Information
provided by Leon <Leon@caresystems.com.au>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.301  2000/02/13 21:26:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the calculator supports commas like in C code. Patch from
Burton. I also documented more details of the new calculator.<br>
<li> Fixed: The >= of the calculator had a typo that prevented it to work.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.300  2000/02/13 20:55:18  set<br>
<li> Added: shtml files to the html syntax. Suggested by Gregorio.<br>
<li> Added: Real support for Texinfo 4.0's Ref: references. They jump to the
correct node and positions the cursor at the right line.<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to have two files with the same file name in
projects if they are different files (from different directories). After some
talk with Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.299  2000/02/13 14:01:11  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the list of functions takes the word under cursor including
colons. That's needed for C++. Suggested by Alex.<br>
<li> Added: Now the list of functions is more cleaver and looks for C++ members
with the name of the word under cursor if no function with this name was
found.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some potential GPF and fails to update the new entries in the user
words.<br>
<li> Fixed: GPFs produced by the column and row cursors when the cursor was
outside the visible area.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.298  2000/02/05 21:44:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some spelling errors (remmember, allready and latter). Reported by
Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de> and Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<br>
<li> Added: Now double clicking in Alt+0 window is the same as pressing the Go
button. Suggested by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<br>
<li> Fixed: ESC doesn't reset the palette to defaults in the palette dialog.
Reported by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the FileOpen dialog used in the project and MP3 list says
"Done" instead of "Cancel". Suggested by Waldemar Schultz
<schultz@ma.tum.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.297  2000/02/03 01:19:08  set<br>
<li> Modified: The version of some tools I use in the README.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] Explanation to one posible source of "can't open terminal"
error in the FAQ.<br>
<li> Fixed: [InfView] Now "Open InfView" works even if no InfView window is
opened. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Modified: All the needed places to support the new location of TV headers.
It changed the dependencies.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.295  2000/01/26 00:41:53  set<br>
<li> Added: Now InfView also looks for .info.bz2 and .bz2 files. So entering
(editor) InfView will try to load editor.bz2 and editor.info.bz2. Only when
bzip2 support is compiled.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.294  2000/01/26 00:25:10  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A small error in the MSVC errors parsing. Pointed out by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor alters the W9x window title adding information about
the version and loaded project. That's what "Jeremy W. Murphy"
<jwm@amc.com.au> originally suggested. I do it in a way that it isn't
permanent, even if the program crashes.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.293  2000/01/22 17:57:49  set<br>
<li> Added: A new calculator parser from Burton Radons. It adds conditionals,
variables definitions and function definitions. The old parser and a small
version of this new one can be selected during configuration.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.292  2000/01/20 00:55:20  set<br>
<li> Updated: Copyrights for year 2000.<br>
<li> Added: Copyright of bzip2 and knowledgement in the about box. Also for
Zlib.<br>
<li> Added: Jump to last column, it could need some adjusts. Is supposed to be
the equivalent of g-end in VI. Suggested by Leon <Leon@caresystems.com.au>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.291  2000/01/18 00:01:42  set<br>
<li> Added: Configurable status line. So now is possible to configure all the
keys used by the editor, specially Copy/Paste in input lines. Dean Limbaugh
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us> and Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de> were two of
the users that asked for it, I just don't remember the rest.<br>
<li> Added: Transparent support for bzip2 compressed files. It works for regular
files and info files. The info file should have the same extension used by
gz. I know Mandrake uses bzip2 compressed info files but don't know the exact
name so I guess it will need some adjusts. It also means the executable is
larger. And the memory requirements for saving bzip2 files are big. I added
it after a report from Salazar <jsalaz3@almez.pntic.mec.es> talking about
problems with Mandrake 6.0.
<hr>v0.4.41 14th public release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.290  2000/01/02 19:31:56  set<br>
<li>Fixed: Problems with project files. Reported by Ryan Owen <ryan@eyring.com>.<p>

Table Of Contents.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.287  1999/12/31 15:16:22  set<br>
<li> Added: A new menu option to save the project manually. Suggested by

<li> Fixed: [Linux] A bug introduced in 1.209/10 revisions when saving files
in DOS format. Reported by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.284  1999/12/29 00:56:53  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the project window also says the name of the project file.
Suggested by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Applied: Changes to the Debian packaging files. Now the infview can be
generated as another package. From Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.283  1999/12/21 23:49:11  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug in sLisp when handling strings with escape sequences
(\n, \t, etc.). Probably introduced in 1.187. Reported by Uwe Steinmann
<steinm@majestix.fernuni-hagen.de>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.282  1999/12/19 21:48:31  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Now you can pass extra command line options using an environment
variable called SET_CMDLINE.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.281  1999/12/19 19:57:20  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Support for .info files created with texinfo 4.0 that includes Ref:
tags in the indirect table. I didn't investigate how they work but the files
can be used.<br>
<li> Added: Support for makeinfo from texinfo 4.0 to generate the documentation.
I needed to fool makeinfo adding an extra @contents at the top of the txt
file, don't know why. Reported by Ivan who is using Potato (Debian 2.2).<br>
<li> Added: New command line option +[line number], like in VI. Suggested by
Ivan, looks like some tools uses it, in this way we can just replace VI by
SETEdit when using these tools.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.280  1999/12/05 16:16:42  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Now when calling the man page viewer the editor offers the word
under cursor as man page.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.279  1999/12/05 15:34:18  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: Version to 0.4.41.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] When switching from hidden to normal desktop files the
editor left the hidden version of the desktop file generating potential
confusions. Now the hidden file is removed. That's i just another annoyiance
of the silly hidden files mechanism.<br>
<li> Modified: [DOS] Now the editor also looks for HOME and HOMEDIR when loading
configuration files. Also: the directory where the exe is located is the one
looked at last.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.278  1999/11/30 00:25:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The ~K~eep short-cut in the SDG options was used for O~K~. Reported
by Gregorio.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the message window shows ^M if the line contains /r.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.277  1999/11/29 23:33:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: GPF/SIGSEGV when using BackSpace in the functions list to delete the
first letter in the incremental search. Reported by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.276  1999/11/21 21:25:58  set<br>
<li> Added: Configurable mechanism to parse the errors collected from an
external application. It uses Perl RegEx to do the job. Suggested by
Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.275  1999/11/21 14:37:44  set<br>
<li> Added: A new shl flag "EscapeAnywhere" this switch makes the editor parse
the escape character outside strings.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.274  1999/11/21 12:49:57  set<br>
<li> Changed: The way the INFOPATH is guessed under DOS. A djgpp user installed
the editor outside the djgpp tree and then the editor used INFOPATH but
failed to find the setedit.inf file. Now the editor also adds your tree even
if INFOPATH is defined. Reported by Sylvia <smlew@ifocus.com.sg>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.273  1999/11/20 15:28:44  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When inserting items to the project the editor used the *.epr mask
instead of the one used to open regular files. Reported by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.272  1999/11/20 14:41:23  set<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for PLM/51 contributed by Jari Korhonen
<jari.korhonen@ponsse.fi>. (Intel's long-gone not-so-highlevel language for
8051 CPUs).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.271  1999/11/05 00:28:59  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Compilation problems with gcc 2.95 in the plasma stuff.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] ISO-8859-1 spanish messages.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.270  1999/10/30 20:50:55  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Spanish messages to Linux distribution, that's the first try and
needs more work.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.269  1999/10/30 15:30:38  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: A command line switch to specify files to load from an external list
of files where each line is a file. Suggested by SpaZe.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.268  1999/10/30 14:51:41  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: New command line switches to the --help help and the man page.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.267  1999/10/30 14:40:57  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: Now if you use "load only specified files" the editor doesn't
really load the files to then close'm like before. Now the TCEditor class
have a special flag to simulate the load without actually loading the file
content. Only the InfView windows are actually loaded. It makes things
faster.<br>
<li> Added: Three command line switches: --tile-vert, --tile-horiz and --cascade
to make these operations after loading the files from the desktop file or
named in the command line. Suggested by Spaze.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.266  1999/10/30 13:34:38  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: Now the new option to search the word when you press ^F1 inside
the node takes the visible name you choose from the list and not the word
under cursor. Suggested by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.265  1999/10/29 01:48:14  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] call to dch to update the Debian version during the package
creation. Suggested by Ivan.<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] InfView man page. Pointed out by Ivan,<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.264  1999/10/29 00:54:28  set<br>
<li> Added: The reverse operation for "HTML accents". Suggested by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.263  1999/10/26 00:04:43  set<br>
<li> Added: [Linux] Now the convert HTML accents feature also works in Linux,
was just matter of enabling it.<br>
<li> Added: Now the file open dialog is resizeble. Suggested by Gregorio.<br>
<li> Modified: [Linux] Now the editor disables the Xon/Xoff mode of the terminal
so ^Q/^S aren't used for it. It enables the use of ^Q and ^S when running in
an Xterm, Eterm, etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.262  1999/10/23 19:50:08  set<br>
<li> Added: Yet another tab mode. "Tab indents", it is by default enabled
because that's what the editor ever did. Disabling it the editor will behave

<li> Added: An option to make InfView search the word under cursor when you did
a syntax search, but inside the selected topic. Hmmm... how to explain it,
just use ^F1 and see. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com><br>

hints. Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au><br>
<li> Added: [Linux] The no/overwrite status is showed in the indicator (at the
right of the modified star). Suggested by Dean Limbaugh

menu.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.256  1999/10/14 01:17:33  root<br>
<li> Removed the libamp from the Linux distribution, it isn't needed and the
copyright could produce some confusion.<br>
<li> Fixed: I forgot to add infview.mak to the list of makefiles to patch.<br>
<li> Fixed: A multiline crossreference in the documentation.<p>

<li> Added: sLisp command AskString, it pop-up a dialog asking for user input.<br>
<li> Added: Some documentation about the mouse under Linux. Suggested by Ivan.<br>
<li> Changed: The example of macro from menu is now more useful, it pop-ups a
dialog and you can enter a command, the output of this command is inserted at
the cursor position. Ivan asked for such an option from the menu.<br>
<li> Added: Now the sLisp InsertText function doesn't allow the insertion of
text with \n and not \r\n under DOS (not well tested).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.251  1999/10/10 21:43:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Target all must be the first in the makefile.<br>
<li> Fixed: Target infview needs to be PHONY because doesn't have dependencies.<br>

<li> Added: Basic TeX syntax highlight, contributed by Alexander Bokovoy.<br>
<li> Added: TCL syntax highlight, contributed by FireEgl <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<br>
<li> Added: Wrapper example for collecting Turbo Pascal 7.0 errors. Contributed
by Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net>.<br>
<li> Added: --libset option to the configure script, it creates targets in the
makefile for libset.a (needed for RHIDE). Requested by Robert.<br>
<li> Added: InfView to the configure mechanism and --no-infview to avoid
compiling it.<br>
<li> Modified: now the Makefile generated by configure script is more modular so
you can do "make editor", "make infview", "make install-editor", etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.248  1999/10/02 18:51:19  set<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp command ShortFileName. Needed to pass SFNs to external

<li> Fixed: A lot of warnings from gcc 2.95, don't know if all (const missing
type, char * not const, assembler clobber lists, etc.).<br>
<li> Added: Now the code page remapping routines converts symbols not found in
the destination code page to similar ones. Example: accented letter to same
letter not accented. It works for latin symbols, now I'm waiting for
Alexander's tables for cyrilic symbols.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.246  1999/09/30 02:58:16  set<br>
<li> Added: Code page remaping. It should work for all the supported code pages.
Documented, added to menues, translated to spanish, etc. I was thinking about
adding it because I write some mails in DOS and then Alexander Bokovoy asked
for it (for russian code pages, they are a mess). The last settings are
stored in the desktop file so new version 0.4.37.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.245  1999/09/29 00:39:39  set<br>
<li> Added: A new editor command called cmcCutClipWin to cut text to Windows
clipboard. Suggested by Spaze. I also mention it in the documentation and
give an example in redmond.smn about how to use the Windows clipboard instead
of the internal one.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.244  1999/09/29 00:08:02  set<br>
<li> Added: The emu387.dxe emulator so the editor can be installed in systems
without coprocessor. Suggested and tested by "Eathan Clark"
<eathan@cableone.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.243  1999/09/28 23:20:29  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if the message window is outside the screen that's fixed at load
time. I don't really know the reason for it but Gregorio and me experimented
it. Is something related with running the editor with different screen
resolutions. Reported by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.242  1999/09/28 23:06:39  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] Paste in input likes failed. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: When pasting in input lines not all the text was selected and the
cursor wasn't well positioned.<br>
<li> Fixed: The new special character shl feature wasn't parsed by the
multilines parser, only for the painting parser. Reported by "FireEgl
(Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<br>
<li> Added: Now if you double click over name(section) construction in a man
page window the editor jumps to this manpage. Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.241  1999/09/28 03:32:55  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: configure mechanism wasn't setting the static/dynamic exe correctly.<br>
<li> Removed debian/rhide.env from CVS and makes/lista.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.240  1999/09/28 03:03:07  root (set)<br>
<li> Applied patches for the Debian package from Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor was creating a tcedit.dst file in /usr/share/setedit if
you selected to save only one centralized file. That isn't correct, this
directory could be read-only. If you want default options to be global for all
the users you can copy tcedit.dst to /usr/share/setedit, but the editor won't
save there; the HOME directory will be used instead. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: debian/doc-base was missing in the distribution.<br>
<li> Fixed: Compilation problems with glibc 2.1.2 because the use of __USE_GNU
instead of _GNU_SOURCE. Patch from Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.239  1999/09/26 20:30:43  set<br>
<li> Added: Jump to prototype command. That's very similar to jump to function.
Suggested by Pavlos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.238  1999/09/26 16:34:58  set<br>
<li> Added: MP3's ID3 genre field to the MP3 dialog. "Pavlos" <gtoub@otenet.gr>
provided the first 100 names and I added another 42 from WinAmp 1.90.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.237  1999/09/26 15:15:35  set<br>
<li> Documented: The new match directives for SHL.<br>
<li> Added: A rudimentary SHL for Makefiles.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.236  1999/09/26 14:35:08  set<br>
<li> Added: Conditional compilation for PCRE>=2.0 and <=2.05 from the configure
script (was present manually).<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to associate a SHL with a file name using regular
expressions (PCREs). You can give regex to match the file name or the whole
path+name. It is needed for things like makefiles and was asked by Ivan and
Gregorio. (NameMatch and FullNameMatch).<br>
<li> Modified: Now the configure script for Linux can take any amount of
parameters. Patch by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.235  1999/09/25 20:46:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: An error in the configure script, it wasn't saving the version of
the detected zlib (the code tested instead ;-))<br>
<li> Fixed: When adding new user words they wasn't visible until the next
redraw, that's forced now.<br>
<li> Fixed: It was posible to save a block with the name of an opened file. Even
when the editor issued a warning about overwriting a file it could have bad
side effects.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.234  1999/09/25 19:30:07  set<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to indicate that EOLComment1 must be in the first
column and EOLComment2 don't.<br>
<li> Added: Now is also possible to tell to the editor that an EOLComment is
valid if it's located in the first non-blank character. Seems to be needed
for TCL. Suggested by "FireEgl (Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.233  1999/09/25 18:01:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] A bug in djgpp v2.02 libc system() function that left child
exes opened leaking file handles and preventing external compilers to
overwrite the file. It only happened for non-djgpp programs. "Andreas
Leidner" <leidner@gmx.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.232  1999/09/25 16:52:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: One define in windoldap.h file. Reported by Pavlos.<br>
<li> Fixed: An egcs warning (egcs bug) reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.<br>
<li> Fixed: [DOS] Wrong manifest file name for InfView. Reported by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<br>
<li> Fixed: Two typos (asigNment). Reported by Spaze.<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.231  1999/09/25 16:34:57  root<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] The editor was creating userwords.txt and default settings
in /usr/share/setedit instead of user's home. Reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] SIGSEGVs when using hidden desktop files. Reported by Ilker
Aksen <Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.230  1999/09/25 14:31:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When Match Pair and Wrap Columns were enabled and the match happened
in the wrap column the editor did really stupid things.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.229  1999/09/25 02:01:26  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: A crash when a file failed to load [only seen in Linux]. Reported by
Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>.<br>
<li> Fixed: If the file had less than 2 bytes it was reported as a read error
[only under Linux and when using glibc 2.1]. Reported by Steve Wagor
<stevew@uis.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.228  1999/09/25 01:00:13  set<br>
<li> Fixed: various typos in the web page, thanks to Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.227  1999/09/25 00:27:34  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor pass to external screen savers a file handle for a
file that contains the screen contents. It allows external screen savers
based on the current screen contents. Suggested by Gregorio.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.226  1999/09/24 02:55:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The Info and Help buttons of the Screen Savers setup window were
ever enabled and generated SIGSEGVs if used for internal screen savers.
Reported by Gregorio. Also by Ilker Aksen <Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.225  1999/09/24 00:20:33  set<br>
<li> Modified name to ForceUpdate because that's better and was the name I used
in the list.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.224  1999/09/24 00:17:27  set<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp command: ForceRedraw asked by Endlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.223  1999/09/21 00:39:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When Alt+F2 didn't find any function it said No instead of Ok in the
dialog. Reported by Jeremy.<br>
<li> Added: sLisp constants for WhichEditor to avoid "magic numbers",
documented.<br>
<li> Added: GetSyntaxAtCursor sLisp command to know if the cursor is inside a
comment, a preprocessor line or a string. Suggested by Endlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.222  1999/09/19 20:53:44  set<br>
<li> Added: Full list of Spanish messages. Also fixed some menu and dialog
messages while testing the Spanish messages (cosmetic stuff).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.221  1999/09/19 14:33:28  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the InfView desktop file is called infview.dkt.<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView wasn't inserting the new infview windows as tileable so Tile
didn't work. (Both also for the LDD).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.220  1999/09/19 14:23:12  set<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView didn't paint the first match in a search across a file that
forced a node switch, other matchs in the same node were painted.<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView left the match selection on after a node switch and was
visible until the cursor was moved.<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView v0.2.4 said v0.2.5.<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView command line example said `info' instead of `infview'
(imagine why ;-))<br>
<li> Fixed: InfView was giving the same priority to partial matchs and perfect
matchs when the partial appears first. (in search best match member).<br>
<li> Fixed: The cmcForceMatchPairHL command was recorded when recording macros
from keyboard so the length of the macro was enlarged without gaining any
functionallity, now is filtered.
<< All these bugs were detected by me while preparing a conference for the
<< Linux Demo Day here in Buenos Aires ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.219  1999/09/17 03:43:42  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Support for FHS in the configure script and the Linux compress
script.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some details in the configure mechanism for Linux.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.218  1999/09/16 02:25:38  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the file dialog stores the path in the history even if you
abort. It also remmembers the last mask used. Suggested by Pavlos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.217  1999/09/15 23:50:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The calendar object was pretending to be an ASCII table so when its
window was closed it didn't remove yourself from the list making Alt+0 to
crash. Reported by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au> and "Pavlos"
<gtoub@otenet.gr>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.216  1999/09/15 23:18:18  set<br>
<li> Documented new commands and linked to the contex sensitive help.<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor was trying a partial match for a reserved word before to
check for a full match with a user reserved word. It could be experimented
only with the Texinfo shl; I noticed it while updating the docs.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.215  1999/09/15 22:50:30  set<br>
<li> Added: cmcPushCursorPos and cmcPopCursorPos. They use a 12 levels (11
usable) circular stack (to avoid memory leaks). Added to the Edit menu.<br>
<li> Added: cmcToggleCharCase "This is vi's '~' command -- it toggles the
case of the char under the cursor". Added to menu, also added block to
upper/lower. Both additions were suggested by Thiago F.G. Albuquerque
<thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.214  1999/09/12 19:43:01  set<br>
<li> Added: A lot of stuff for the configure mechanism, now it have the minimal
functionallity needed and works OK. I also added comments to the README,
added checks for consistency between the version.txt file and headers, fixed
various problems with the libamp compilation, etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.213  1999/09/12 00:18:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] the editor didn't read the right keybind.dat file. So
defining/undefining keys under Linux was quite hard. The file is created as
.keybind.dat and the editor was looking for keybind.dat. I don't remmember
when this problem was introduced.<br>
<li> Fixed: Preprocessor lines that included a comment were drawn with an ASCII
0 at the end of the line. That's usually invisible, but not when using
ISO-LAT1U fonts (mainly Linux).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.212  1999/09/12 00:09:35  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A couple of bugs in the "delete file from disk" feature of the
windows list: a) Using a freed pointer and b) Asking for save a file that
will be erased anyways.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.211  1999/09/08 00:13:22  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: A check to see if the current directory is valid. Using bash you can
easilly delete the current directory and be "in the land of nowhere". If you
run the editor from such a place it gets really confused and does really
stupid things so is better to just abort and ask the user to be serious.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.210  1999/09/07 23:54:30  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: Save files as DOS (under Linux) could fail. It was mostly related to
the previous bug, but I added some code to make it independient.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.209  1999/09/07 23:44:18  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: Linux version wasn't converting DOS files to UNIX format. The result
was mixed style files! Don't know why I never saw this error.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.208  1999/09/07 23:00:27  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now ^C and ^/ are disabled in Linux.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.207  1999/09/04 20:53:44  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the pseudo macros can be selected from the menu. It helps
people to learn what pmacros are available. To allow it now each pmacros have
a descriptive name. This addition is to allow more powerful pmacros in the
future. Documented.<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for the Export as HTML feature.<br>
<li> Added: An option to export the text as HTML but without using colors.
.<hr>v0.4.35 12th public release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.206  1999/09/03 23:34:41  set<br>

<b>Revision</b> 1.204  1999/09/03 00:24:48  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: Problems when using more than 128 columns. Now the limit is 255x255.<br>
<li> Fixed: Redraw needed when loading a desktop that was used with a big
resolution in one smaller [under Linux]. Is funny to see how the editor
reacts if you change from 80x25 to 132x60 using SVGATextMode in other console
while the editor is running.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.203  1999/09/02 00:17:50  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the amount of closed windows remmembered in the Alt+0 list is
configurable from Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General. Suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.202  1999/09/01 23:48:24  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now sLisp commands (and ...) and (or ...) are logical operators.<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp operators (& ...) and (| ...) bitwise counterparts.
Suggested by Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Fixed: Windows that had a "remmembered" mode with column cursor on produced
SIGSEGVs because of some unitialized variable.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.201  1999/09/01 02:14:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor was asking for save when switching to other window and
the current was modified.<br>
<li> Added: Export as HTML option. Suggested by Pavlos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.200  1999/08/30 22:26:17  set<br>
<li> Fixed: I forgot to include the extrscsv.txt file in the 0.4.34 distribution
so external screen savers aren't accessable from the menu :-(. So only some
users will be able to try'em.
<hr>v0.4.34 11th public release. Released as beta because of problems.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.199  1999/08/29 18:34:49  root (set)<br>

<li> Fixed: SIGSEGV (under Linux and pure DOS) when trying to modify an empty
list of user reserved words.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.197  1999/08/29 14:46:08  set<br>
<li> Added: Comments about the new switch for buggy BIOSes in the DOS/Windows
FAQ.<br>
<li> Fixed: uppercase user reserved words not working for C files. Reported by
Pavlos.<br>
<li> Fixed: OK button grayed when editing user reserved words and none was
entered. Reported by Pavlos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.196  1999/08/26 01:57:20  set<br>
<li> Cosmetic change in install.cc to avoid Allegro's color depths and joystick
drivers to be included (I already ensure it in another way). Suggested by
Pavlos.<br>
<li> Fixed: An outdated command in the mp3 playing files about Allegro's low
quality sound. Pointed out by Pavlos.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.195  1999/08/26 01:39:31  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug in the MP3 player PAUSE. Reported by Pavlos <gtoub@otenet.gr><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.194  1999/08/25 02:52:45  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: The man page to the Linux package and installation process.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.193  1999/08/25 01:18:44  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: The sleep time when idle under Linux. I reduced it to just 10
microseconds because if I let 1 ms the keyboard repeat rate becomes erratic.
Don't know exactly what's wrong. Doing it the editor doesn't eat CPU and works
ok.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.192  1999/08/25 00:04:43  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the sLisp ComplChoose doesn't wait for keystrokes if no
expression is provided or just one is provided. Pointed out by Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Documented: The existence and use of the sLisp command "if". I exist since
the starting days but never was documented.<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp commands: and or not<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.191  1999/08/22 23:25:31  set<br>
<li> Upgrade to PCRE 2.07.<br>
<li> Fixed: various warnings from gcc 2.96.<br>
<li> Fixed: Transparent blocks bug that was experimented when using white as
selection color. I saw it while Agata was using the editor ... this girl will
blow my brains in one or another way.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.190  1999/08/22 21:03:24  set<br>
<li> Added: Some FAQs to the DOS FAQs file about the mouse.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.189  1999/08/22 20:44:28  set<br>
<li> Modified: Some small details in the readme files to make them easier for
Linux people. Looks like some of them are too much structured and fails to
find things if they have a small difference. Suggested by Taura
<learfox@deltanet.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.188  1999/08/22 20:29:04  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Problems when pressing ^/ under W9x. This key triggers SIGQUIT in
djgpp's library but for some reason this mechanism fails and finally makes
W9x get upset. Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.187  1999/08/22 20:01:08  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now sLisp strings supports escape sequences similar to the ones
used for C. There are a small difference: /n is expanded as /r/n for DOS and
to get just /n you must use /l (stands for Line feed). Previous behavior was
expand the escape sequences only when inserting text to an editor buffer. I
did it to fix some problems in an example provided by Endlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.186  1999/08/21 02:32:33  set<br>
<li> New!: Man page viewer incorporated to the editor.<br>
<li> Fixed: One keywords line in the PICs shl.<br>
<li> Modified: Easydiag input line to accomodate to the new feature in TV that
fixed the need of an extra character for small input lines.<br>
<li> Fixed: The "resume" information for project and closed windows now changed
the version because in 0.4.31 the layout of the flags changed. *NHP*<br>
<li> Added all the man page files to the source distribution.<br>
<li> Added: A command line option to use the low level VGA routines to
save/restore the video modes. It seems to help for some buggy Matrox drivers.<br>
<li> Fixed: Streamable constructors of TDskWin classes didn't initialize the
CanBeDeletedFromDisk flag. *NHP*.<br>
<li> Added: Warning in the snap shot html page about the need of getting the
last version available of TV to compile the editor (snap shot version).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.185  1999/08/13 01:16:36  set<br>
<li> Added: Optional flag to sLisp's RunProgram to restore the screen after
running the program.<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp command called strxlt to replace characters in strings.
Both to solve inconvenients running some DOS programs like mpasm (Grzegorz
pointed out the problems).<br>
<li> Fixed: Problems when loading desktop files that makes references to syntax
highlight modes not found in the syntahl.shl file.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.184  1999/08/12 23:23:04  set<br>
<li> Added: Some extra checks to the flush undo info (used by expand/compact
tabs options) it could be the reason of some misterious crashes that Grzegorz
reported.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.183  1999/08/07 22:11:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The editor was creating read-only desktop files so they weren't
easy to update ;-). That's the default for open (I used it for a test).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.182  1999/08/07 21:27:51  set<br>
<li> Updated the license of Robert Hoehne.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.181  1999/08/07 19:49:18  set<br>
<li> Added: man pages for the editor and infview.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.180  1999/08/07 15:09:03  set<br>
<li> Added: External screen savers. Now you can write your own screen saver and
plug it in the editor. Requested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com>.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the screen savers configuration have your own dialog because
now there are more things to configure. Documented. Linked with the help.<br>
<li> Added: Four plasma screen savers (external ones). The sources are also
available (uses my plasma library). Added as optional in the DOS installer.<br>
<li> Added: MakeHzGroup to easydiag.<br>
<li> Added: Command line options for the external screen saver is stored in the
desktop file so the version changed: v0.4.34.<br>
<li> Changed: the default sorting for File Open dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.179  1999/08/03 02:56:10  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the sorting criteria of the files and directories in the
FileOpen dialogs can be customized. I added it to TV and now I added the
needed dialogs to the editor, the options are stored in the desktop file,
there are help available and the editor also gives some advices about the use
of SHIFT key. I did it as a result of a thread in djgpp list started by
Thiago <thiagofga@ambr.com.br>, supported by Clemens Valens
<c.valens@mindless.com> and discussed by Rolf Campbell
<cp1v45@nortelnetworks.com> and Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.178  1999/08/01 21:01:45  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: The screen saver weren't working under Linux. Reported by Grzegorz.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the text mode screen savers are adjusted to the size of the
screen. Suggested by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.177  1999/08/01 19:43:55  set<br>
<li> Fixed: In the overwrite warning the editor was checking if the user
answered No, but then if the user pressed ESC the action was performed, which
is really no intuitive.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.176  1999/08/01 19:33:46  set<br>
<li> Added: new sLisp command getenv, is just like the C version but also gives
access to the internal environment variables. Documented. Suggested by Thiago
<thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.<br>
<li> Added: examples of getenv and the completion chooser to the examples.slp
file.<br>
<li> Added: comments about x:/dev under DOS to the FAQ.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.175  1999/08/01 17:56:49  set<br>
<li> Added: ASCII Chart and Calendar windows. First suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>, second just because I don't know in what day I live
;-)). The code comes from the Robert's port of TVDemo with some small
changes.<br>
<li> Modified: The mechanism to remove windows from the Alt+0 list. I added a
new broadcast to the library sent any time a window is closed. So now the
main application class of SETEdit receives this broadcast and removes the
window from the list. I hope I didn't break anything, the mechanism is really
complex, even when it simplified things a lot.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.174  1999/08/01 13:38:18  set<br>
<li> Added: Now you can set the editor to tile windows first vertically (instead
of horizontally). Is in the general options. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam
Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com>. New version forced by stored value v0.4.33.<br>
<li> Added: Warning about running windowed in Diamond Stealth 2000 Turbo boards.
Diamond drivers are really buggy, specially stealth ones, I have a couple at
work and they are really buggy.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.173  1999/07/27 02:04:54  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: (strstr target_string search_string [start_offset]) -> position or<br>-1 sLisp command. Suggested by Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Fixed: [Linux] Now when the editor is started with a resolution different
than the last used the windows are resized to fit in the new desktop size.
Reported by Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.172  1999/07/26 23:43:53  set<br>
<li> Added: A couple of Q/A to the linux faq from problems experimented by
Grzegorz.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.171  1999/07/26 23:18:20  set<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to delete a file from the Alt+0 list for good, I
mean really unlink it in the filesystem (delete, erase, kill, etc.). That's
pressing Ctrl+Del and of course previous user confirmation that (of course
again ;-) can be disabled. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz
<gradha@iname.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.170  1999/07/25 17:04:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: In jump to function, if the word under cursor was "greater" than the
last function name (alphabetically) the dialog selected an invalid item.
Reported by John Scott Kjellman <jkjellman@ameritech.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.169  1999/07/25 16:03:33  set<br>
<li> Fixed: SaveAs was setting the title of new files even if the save failed.
Reported by Jeremy.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.168  1999/07/25 15:48:09  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A typo in the Tip number 17. Reported by Enlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.167  1999/07/25 15:09:00  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the right button of the mouse pop-ups a menu. The menu is fully
customizable from the menubind.smn file. By default it contains: syntax help,
jump to function, find, replace, copy, paste and cut. I had it in mind for a
long time and a suggestion from Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au> made me
incorporate it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.166  1999/07/25 00:28:43  set<br>
<li> Added: New sLisp command: ComplChoose, it pop-ups a list of options at the
cursor position. The pressed keys are used for incremental search, any valid
symbol for the current SHL select the focused item most of other keystrokes
rejects the selection returning an empty string. Is fully oriented to word
completion. Suggested by Endlisnis for Lemur.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.165  1999/07/22 00:25:30  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Opened files failed to inherit the "See Tabs" and "No inside tabs"
flags. Damn, I really forgot them in all the places. Reported by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Added: A new option to highlight the matching pairs on the fly. It is
called 500 ms after you stop typing to avoid slow downs because an excess of
computations that aren't really needed. Suggested by Ivan.
The setting is stored in the desktop files so the version is 0.4.32 now.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.164  1999/07/21 01:11:46  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The Tool&Ops|Options|Default global edition dialogs asked if the
user wanted to lose the changes with the reverse logic (when the user tried
to not lose ;-))<br>
<li> Fixed: New file doesn't have syntax hl, but didn't inherit the default
options for files without syntax hl.<br>
<li> Added: Now the snap-shot script generates valid files for DOS and UNIX no
matters what OS is used to generate the files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.163  1999/07/18 23:20:41  set<br>
<li> Added: a Perl script to generate diffs between the current WIP and any CVS
tag. This will allow me to upload diffs and snap-shots.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.162  1999/07/17 22:26:11  root (set)<br>
<li> Added needed scripts and modified small details to create and package
InfView for Linux.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.161  1999/07/17 21:41:05  set<br>
<li> New!: A new standalone program can be created from the sources, is called
infview and is just an standalone info viewer. It have a command line very
similar to the FSF's info program. Many users asked for it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.160  1999/07/17 01:11:05  set<br>
<li> Added: Search only in/outside comments options to the Find and Replace
dialogs. It forced to rearrange the editorFlags so the version changed
(v0.4.31). Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.159  1999/07/16 22:53:37  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Cursor moved outside the screen when using non-persistent blocks and
replacing a selection by a typed character. Reported by Endlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.158  1999/07/16 01:45:16  set<br>
<li> Added: Now is possible to delete entries in the message box. I also added
the possibility to save the messages to a text file or copy to the clipboard.
All started with some suggestions from SpaZe.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.157  1999/07/15 03:07:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor commands are disabled during initialization, not only
when an editor loses the focus. In this way if you start with a clean desktop
the commands are disabled.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.156  1999/07/15 03:05:01  set<br>
<li> Added: The screen saver is activated if you left the mouse in the upper
right corner for a configurable period of time. Suggested by Spaze.
Also added to the general configuration and desktop file => v0.4.30.
<hr>v0.4.29 10th public release. Scheduled uploads to DJ's server, my three
sites, mails to Ivan and DanX, etc.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.155  1999/07/14 23:31:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: 3 warnings from gcc 2.96.<br>
<li> Fixed: I forgot dstfile.cc in the distribution.<br>
<li> Fixed: If no dflopts.txt existed the flags to set the SHL were 0 (all local
options disabled!).<br>
<li> Fixed: The OK button was grayed when editing the default options. Also added
a confirm before discarding potential changes.<br>
<li> Fixed: multiline strings wrongly propagated if the contained an empty line
in the middle (only Linux).<br>
<li> Note: all of this just before releasing, it delayed the release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.154  1999/07/13 22:48:45  set<br>
<li> Fixed: BASIC shl needed AllowedInsideNames=$. Patch by Endlisnis
<s257m@unb.ca><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.153  1999/07/13 02:12:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Problems to redirect the output of childs when TMPDIR (or equivalent
variable) was defined as something like "x:/". That's because djgpp tools
gets upset if you use a file name like it: "c://file" (even when c://file is
valid both in djgpp and Linux). Is a very bad idea to define the variable
like this because other programs also have problems, I saw it in CVS while
comminting the changes.<br>
<li> Note: Robert should do the same in RHIDE, in fact debugging it was slooowww
because RHIDE was failing to create some temporals and for some reason mktemp
becomes ultra-slow in this case.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.152  1999/07/13 00:46:17  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Eterm theme, terminal description and full explanation.<br>
<li> Added: Some hints about it in the readme.src and readme.1st.<br>
<li> Added: All the changes and additions to the readme.1st.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.151  1999/07/12 00:04:37  set<br>
<li> New! "Default global edition" menu option. It was something I needed for
months and didn't have time to add. It's a complement for the "Global
Options" but sensitive to the syntax highlight for the current file. When the
editor selects the shl also enables/disables some local options related to
this shl. All of this is stored in an easy-to-edit text file, but also you
can edit it with nice dialogs ;-). Is documented and pressing F1 explains
how it works.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.150  1999/07/11 14:16:08  set<br>
<li> New! now you can define your own reserved words (user words) using dialogs
or just editing a text file.<br>
<li> Added: Documentation, F1 hook and tip for the user words.<br>
<li> Modified: Some important internal structures were modified. The main
important change is that I no longer use a SOSStack for the syntax highlight
strings, now all are separated strings. So the call to
LoadSyntaxHighLightFile changed a little bit.<br>
<li> Note: This is all very new and not very well tested, don't expect 100%
reliable behavior and report any strange thing.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.149  1999/07/09 19:31:27  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The documentation of RunProgram* to say @var{program_name} instead
of @var{program name} to avoid confusion. Reported by Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Added: Now (+ "Hello" 1) sLisp code returns "Hello1". Endlisnis reported
a problem in one of the examples and instead of limiting the example I
extended the language ;-)<br>
<li> Fixed: Now when asigning a macro to a key the editor doesn't draw the
intermediate steps, it avoid cleaning the status line. Reported by Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Fixed: The RunProgramRedir was returning a non ASCIIZ string. Reported by
Endlisnis.<br>
<li> Fixed: The name of the sLisp command WhichEditor (was WichEditor).<br>
<li> Added: A new optional parameter to sLisp command WordUnderCursor. (see docs)<br>
<li> Added: A new editor's command: cmcGoEndOfWord. (see docs).<br>
<li> Note: These modifications are to give better support to the Lemur v0.1a
prototype completion macro+program created by Endlisnis.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.148  1999/07/09 15:22:29  set<br>
<li> Fixed: G was used twice as short-cut in the Find Dialog. Reported by
Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.<br>
<li> Added: short-cut for the "RegEx Ops" button (O).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.147  1999/07/07 23:59:42  set<br>
<li> Added: Help for the "Open Read-only copy" option (documentation and F1).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.146  1999/07/07 23:50:48  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to open a read only copy of the current file we are
editing from disk.<br>
<li> Fixed: Disabled some commands when no editor is selected: Print, RO copy,
etc.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor windows disables all the commands when they are
unselected. You'll get a lot of gray options if you select a non-editor now.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now InfView windows enables/disables your commands.<br>
<li> Note: I changed some internal stuff: (a) Added a new member to TCommandSet
class to enable/disable groups of commands (b) Added a parameter to
updateCommands, it says if the update is a full one or the class needs to
update just some commands and (c) the rectangular selection commands are
enabled/disableb only after one command related to it is processed, not all
the time.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.145  1999/07/04 15:44:40  set<br>
<li> Added: A progress bar when loading a file greater than 1Mb. The bar is
displayed during the parse process (much slower than the load). I tested it
with the disassebled code of the editor (15Mb ;-).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.144  1999/07/04 15:21:29  set<br>
<li> Added: A command to paste de Emacs mode associated with the current syntax
highlight and the tabsize as a comment at the start of the file. Documented.
Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.143  1999/07/04 13:58:01  set<br>
<li> Added: Added EmacsModes and ShellScript shl commands. Looks like people was
confused about the fact that Files was used for the three so now they are
separated commands.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.142  1999/07/03 19:16:19  set<br>
<li> Added: A blanker to the screen savers. Suggested by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the mouse is hided when the screen saver is on. Reported by
SpaZe.<br>
<li> Added: A test button to make a preview of the screen savers. Suggested by
SpaZe.<br>
<li> Fixed: The name of the "global editor options", now is "general editor
options" Reported by SpaZe.<br>
<li> Added: F3 label in the File|Open menu. Suggested by SpaZe.<br>
<li> Added: Now InfView copies all the #include directives with Alt+I, not just
the first. Suggested by SpaZe.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.141  1999/07/03 17:06:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When redirecting the output of external files if the last line
emitted by the external program didn't have /n it was discarded. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<p><br>-- Sent the change.log to the editor's mailing list (recently created) --<br><b>Revision</b> 1.140  1999/07/02 02:39:37  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now project items are stored as relative names, not absolute. So you
can move projects from one disk to another.<br>
<li> Fixed: The example.zip (for SDG) used absoulte paths so was hard to use.<br>
<li> Added: A warning when adding files that can't be expresed as relative in
the project.<br>
<li> Fixed: The command to go to the end of file didn't compute tabs so if the
last line in the file had tabs the position wasn't the EOL. Reported by
SpaZe / ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<br>
<li> Fixed: When unindenting a block and the cursor was in the previous line of
the first line of the block the editor included it in the selection.<br>
<li> Added: Pseudo-macros for Clipper.<br>
<li> Added: A simple mechanism for "Advice" dialogs (they explain something to
the user and gives the option to not be displayed in the future). So they
will start to appear in many places. I think they are very good to learn. I
really liked it when I tried the VMware beta.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.139  1999/06/30 02:39:34  set<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for the #! stuff in shl files and warnings about the
fact that the editor remmember the shl of files.<br>
<li> Added: @comment as secondary comment for Texinfo files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.138  1999/06/30 02:16:04  set<br>
<li> Added: --no-compress option to the compress scripts. It avoids the call to
upx even when upx is installed in the system. Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.137  1999/06/30 02:08:13  set<br>
<li> Added: A new command cmeDeleteBkps to delete all the backup files memorized
by the editor so you don't need to exit with quit to do it. That's very
useful when used in combination with "Remmember bkps to delete". I put it in
the Tool&Ops menu.<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for it and some entries in the concept index related to
backups.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.136  1999/06/30 00:52:00  set<br>
<li> Fixed: If a comment works only when in first column and is found in other
place the editor now pass it for the other checks (symbol, etc.).<br>
<li> Modified: Small enhancements to the batch files hl. Now more things are
symbol.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.135  1999/06/30 00:34:49  set<br>
<li> Added: New syntax hl. option: "RelaxNumbersCheck", when enabled words that
start with a number aren't indicated as wrong. That's useful for batch files.<br>
<li> Fixed: The '.' can be used inside names in assembler files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.134  1999/06/30 00:10:42  set<br>
<li> Added: "Remmember bkps to delete" option. Useful for users of Alt+Q. It
helps to keep delete the backup files which are useful but annoying.
As that's stored in the desktop file that's a new version: v0.4.29.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.133  1999/06/29 02:26:26  set<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for PICs assembler (16C7x syntax) contributed by
Diego Brengi <brengi@inti.gov.ar>.<br>
<li> Modified: My idea to save a directory read for the open dialog failed for
save as where the setData doesn't pass a wildcard, so now in this case I read
the directory first *NHP*<br>
<li> Added: More checks in the installer for NT.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.132  1999/06/27 20:17:13  set<br>
<li> Updated the documentation for Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General, it was
outdated. Added information for five undocumented options.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.131  1999/06/27 20:07:13  set<br>
<li> Added: An option to the editor's general options. It works this way: when
enabled and if the user specifies at least one file name in the command line
all the windows already opened are closed. In this way only the files
specified in the commnad line are opened. Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.130  1999/06/27 19:37:58  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now is possible to save the current file as UNIX/DOS. That's only
possible for this special case, not saving as other opened file.
Suggested by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.129  1999/06/27 18:58:23  set<br>
<li> Added: Documentation for the rectangular upper/lower commands.<br>
<li> Fixed: The same bug that affected the rectangle paste was in block upper/
lower.<br>
<li> Modified: Now the message that a rectangle can't be pasted outside the text
is reported by editorDialog.<br>
<li> Fixed: When pasting rectangles outside the text using the move operation
you could lose the original text, specially because the undo state was
broken. Now the editor checks before deleting the text and also does it
before starting to fill the undo structure. Reported by
SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.128  1999/06/27 17:52:30  set<br>
<li> Added: cmcSelRectToUpper and cmcSelRectToLower, they convert a rectangular
selection to upper/lower case. They have a side effect: tabs inside and
crossing the boundaries of the selection are converted into spaces. That's
because I first cut the rectangle process the block and then paste it again.
Any other solution will need much more code and make it more complex.
Suggested by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<br>
<li> Fixed: A very old bug while using undo for rectangular selection operations.
I don't know if anothers remains but it was clear: the paste wasn't
initializing the member that indicates how many operations are grouped.
Reported by Alex Lozano and recently by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.127  1999/06/27 16:04:21  set<br>
<li> Moved all the code for loading/storing desktop files from editmain.cc to
a new file called dstfile.cc.<br>
<li> Added: <noscript> and </noscript> to the html syntax hl. file. Suggested
by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.126  1999/06/27 14:50:39  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the "See Tabs" and "No inside tabs" options are stored in the
desktop file. As the desktop file changed that's: v0.4.28.<br>
<li> Added: The "Wrap words" option can be set for all the windows from the
global options dialog. Suggested by SpaZe/ST <stealth.tech@seznam.cz><p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.125  1999/06/26 00:54:35  set<br>
<li> Fixed: A bug when putting the PATH command in the autoexec.bat when the
installer couldn't find the PATH definition. Reported by Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the installer is can detect more cases of the PATH definition.
Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.124  1999/06/24 23:25:08  set<br>
<li> Added: Now I'm forcing some redraws when "See tabs" is enabled and I kill
spaces at the end of a line. In this way the user can see how they disapear.
Suggested by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.123  1999/06/24 22:06:32  set<br>
<li> Added: a "pocket calculator", that's a simple calculator. From TV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.122  1999/06/23 23:11:16  set<br>
<li> Modified: The OK button in the dialog to select MP3 files now says "Select".<br>
<li> Fixed: Now double clicking adds the file to the MP3 list. (Reported by Ivan)<br>
<li> Added: New button to the file open dialogs, it brings the change dir dialog.
Added after some questions from Ivan.<br>
<li> Fixed: An extra directory read when opening a File Dialog.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.121  1999/06/22 22:34:35  set<br>
<li> Added: SpecialSymbol and SpecialSymbolCont to the shl syntax. It allows to
define special symbols constructed by two symbols that combined have a
special meaning. That's very useful for $# in Perl and Bash scripts and @@
for Texinfo files.<br>
<li> Added: PartialKeywords to the shl file. That's used when keywords can be
embedded in other words and still valid, like this @AA is a keyword and
@AAxxxx is @AA keyword plus some text. In this mode the keywords search is
considerably slower. I added it after some mail exchange with Burton Radons
<loth@pacificcoast.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.120  1999/06/18 01:12:06  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now the editor uses 32 bits flags for the syntax highlight stuff.
It consumes more memory but allows me to add better shl.<br>
<li> Added: String3 definition to the syntaxhl.shl files, that's propagated to
the rest of the lines.<br>
<li> Modified: String2 is now propagated too, the old behavior is obtained with
a new command: ShortString.<br>
<li> Fixed: This addition allowed me to fix an annoying problem in the Perl and
Bash syntax highlight. These script languages supports three types of strings
and the three are propagated across lines. Now it works OK.<br>
<li>*Warning** I was careful with the changes and tested that no part is cutting
the attributes to the old size (16 bits), but I can't be sure so this version
is actually qualified as less stable than 0.4.26.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.119  1999/06/17 02:04:28  set<br>
<li> Added: Syntax Highlight for Texinfo files. Contributed by Burton Radons
<loth@pacificcoast.net>.<br>
<li> Fixed: if two shl keywords were different just in the caseness(?) only
the first defined was taked. Example: @aa @AA. I was using a no case
sensitive collection to colect the keywords. Reported by Burton.<br>
<li> Modified (Fixed): Now the editor stores the name of the syntax highlight
instead of the number. Before it if you inserted a definition in the middle
of the shl file you surely created a mess. So desktop files changed and
hence the version: v0.4.27.<br>
<li> Added: Explanation where you must specify the Case keyword in the shl file
in the docs. That's important and wasn't mentioned. Reported by Burton.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.118  1999/06/16 01:35:29  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Now the editor can detect the syntax of a file looking for
#!path/name. This line must be the first in the file. Suggested by Ivan.<br>
<li> Added: Detection for Perl scripts without .pl extension.<br>
<li> Added: Some very primitive syntax highlight for shell scripts. At least
bash supports three strings and the editor just one so the support is weak.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.117  1999/06/15 23:18:41  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: ncurses, gpm and RegDOS credits in the copyrigh file.<br>
<li> Fixed: A problem in the INSTALL.MAK that made it fail if the user already
had the "e" symlink (it was included in the release of v0.4.26, just forgot
to commit).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.116  1999/06/15 23:11:30  set<br>
<li> Fixed: The Global editor options was failing to disable the "See Tabs" and
"Don't move inside tabs" options (I did a cut/paste and forgot to fix it ;-).
Reported by Diego Brengi <brengi@inti.gov.ar> (If I can say it was a report)<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor looks for ~/tcedit.dst and ~/.tcedit.dst, not only
the last.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.115  1999/06/15 22:55:49  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Not restoring the attributes after saving a file. I forgot it in:
<b>Revision</b> 1.94  1999/05/23 19:28:22. Reported by Dean Limbaugh
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.114  1999/06/11 00:15:46  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now if the installer didn't change the autoexec.bat won't suggest
rebooting ;-)<br>
<li> Modified: Now the about box is coherent with the new slogan for the editor:
"A friendly text editor". I changed as a result of some suggestions from
Jose Lacal.<br>
<li> Fixed and Added: a lot of details in the readme.1st file. When I release
the editor I install it in many places so I read it ;-)<br>
<li> Added: information about cwsdpmi, pmodedj and libwin in the copyright file.<br>
<li> Fixed: some out-dated information in the copyright file.<br>
<li> Updated: some information in infview documentation, now the name isn't
uppercase.<br>
<li> Fixed: typos in the windows/dos FAQ.
.<hr>v0.4.26 9th public release. Uploaded to DJ's server (Simtelnet) and my home
page.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.113  1999/06/10 01:39:19  set<br>
<li> Added: Forced LFN=y in installer or it will fail to update menu and desktop
files.<br>
<li> Added: Now the code modifies the .pif files to setup the working directory.
It avoids the creation of tcedit.dst files in the desktop.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.112  1999/06/08 23:53:01  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now I use libwin for the installer, that's faster and not
affected by the WinCrap bug I faced before.<br>
<li> Added: Some (small) instructions about the installer in the readme.src.<br>
<li> Fixed: Some versions and CPU model in readme.src.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.111  1999/06/08 03:03:33  set<br>
<li> Added: Finally I added the installer to the CVS tree. Currently is v1.02
beta, but seems to work acceptable. I added a directory, the sources
(including a patched version of datfile.c from Allegro to save 60Kb in the
final distribution, around 140 in the .exe), changes in the makefiles, added
to the list of files, project and a Perl script to generate the installer.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.110  1999/06/06 16:50:53  set<br>
<li> Modified: The readme and announce files for the new release.<br>
<li> Added: More information about Alt+Mouse in the Linux FAQ.<br>
<li> Fixed: Copyright year in the docs, last update, version, new description
for the dir.info, the description isn't in small caps in the .info (pointed
out by Ivan), fixed a chapter name containing ' (TeX gets confused), generated
the documentation in .dvi, .ps and .html formats and more.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.109  1999/06/05 23:24:14  set<br>
<li> Fixed: 3 warnings reported by egcs 1.1.2 from potato (other snapshots
didn't report it, all related to objects without specified type defaulting
to int). Also added initialization to 2 variables that egcs reports (wrongly)
that can be used unitialized. Warnings provided by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.108  1999/06/05 22:50:21  root (set)<br>
<li> Applied: Patches to the Debian package files from Ivan. Not tested because
I need the potato debhelpers.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.107  1999/06/05 21:40:34  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Typos in the tips file.<br>
<li> Added: Simple menu, tips and desktop files in the distribution for people
that want to use the editor but doesn't know about all of these strange
options included.<br>
<li> Added: EasyDiag features: Multiline support for TSStaticText and wrapping
column. They are used by the WIP installer.<br>
<li> Changed: Version number because desktop files changed. (v0.4.26)<br>
<li> Added: Support for tabs in the printing. Now tabs looks the same as in the
screen. Suggested by Richard Sanders <richard@stardate.bc.ca>.<br>
<li> Changed: Prototype of the PrintSource routine to accept the tabs' size.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.106  1999/05/29 03:01:21  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Now patchenv.pl also fixes the TV dependencies.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.105  1999/05/29 01:35:11  root (set)<br>
<li> Applied diffs for the Debian package files from Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.104  1999/05/29 00:36:24  set<br>
<li> Compiled with the NT additions in TV. Now the editor works in NT Server
4.0 in a machine I have access, don't know others.<br>
<li> Fixed: A syntax highlight bug in the generic engine:
" molw/t0x00/t/t/t;Comment" in a .asm is an example.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.103  1999/05/27 22:05:38  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: The print configuration dialog is now an EasyDiag(tm) dialog and
allows to choose between writing to a file or thru a program using a pipe.<br>
<li> Added: A couple of functions to EasyDiag that makes easy to transfer the
with of the widder object to the rest (Used in the print setup).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.102  1999/05/27 00:41:13  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: A nasty bug. When the editor retreives the settings of a closed file
(you open a file that was previously opened and closed, then the editor
uses the same position, settings, etc.) the closed object was released and
the openFile function was accessing an already released block. Of course the
effect was random and produced two possible things: a) The column cursor
magically appears enabled b) SIGSEGV because (a) with ridiculous values.<br>
<li> Fixed: Memory leak in the new backup list when creating more than one
backup of the same file *NHP*<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.101  1999/05/26 00:31:36  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now I include the "new" header instead of using hardcoded
definitions (editmain.cc). Patch by Robert.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.100  1999/05/26 00:25:35  set<br>
<li> Wow! revision 100<br>
<li> Modified: Went back to -gstabs+, now -gstabs+3. Suggested by Robert (I
disabled it in the past to save memory while debugging).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.99  1999/05/26 00:08:54  set<br>
<li> Fixed: references to str[n]*icmp. Pointed out by Robert.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.98  1999/05/24 00:35:08  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: A warning when switching to the user screen for Linux, that's
because currently the user must press ENTER which is not very intuitive and
the user could think the editor hanged.<br>
<li> Added: Support fot multiline TStatiText in EasyDiag.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.97  1999/05/23 23:45:59  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: More information in the profile editor option. It now gives more
interesting information. I also fixed a problem in the Linux version which
didn't meassured the time consumed by the OS which, in some cases, is very
important. As an example: the editor can do 18560 lines/sec using VCSA and
using all the CPU, but only 1318 using xterm where 80% of the time is spend
by the OS to draw the text. VCSAs are about 5 times faster than using a
ttypN locally and 14 times faster than xterm.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.96  1999/05/23 21:33:35  set<br>
<li> Added: Number of selected lines in the ^Q-L command.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.95  1999/05/23 20:35:30  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor will delete backups of files in other directories
different than the working one, for that the editor keeps a list of created
backups. It also helps to delete files with the new backup options (hidden and
UNIX style).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.94  1999/05/23 19:28:22  set<br>
<li> Added: Hidden backups option.<br>
<li> Modified: Now when a backup is created the editor will use a rename if the
file isn't a symbolic link and a copy only if the file is s.l. That's faster,
specially for large files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.93  1999/05/23 18:35:01  set<br>
<li> Added: my old memmove again, that's twice faster the djgpp's libc version
in my system.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.92  1999/05/23 17:26:33  set<br>
<li> Added: A .pif file for the editor. It have some settings I think are the
best for the editor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.91  1999/05/21 14:06:00  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: IsADirectory for Linux *NHP*<br>
<li> Fixed: Now librhutils won't crash if we couldn't create the temporal file<br>
<li>NHP*<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.90  1999/05/21 03:42:35  set<br>
<li> Added: UNIX style bakup file names (name~).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.89  1999/05/21 02:42:34  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now ".files" are backed-up as ".files.bkp" and not as ".bkp".<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.88  1999/05/21 02:32:09  set<br>
<li> Added: Save DOS files as DOS for UNIX.<br>
<li> Added: Save desktop files as hidden files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.87  1999/05/21 00:09:52  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: Some mouse information in linux.faq (gpm and xterm issues).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.86  1999/05/20 02:14:30  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: The resize attributes of the clock where wrong. I saw it when
resized an xterm from 80x24 to 95x33, the clock just disapear but left a
hole in your place.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.85  1999/05/20 01:48:31  root (set)<br>
<li> Fixed: Some strange bug in Linux when generating the documentation using
SDG, looks like I can't trust feof when fopening with "wt+". I don't
understand it very well, but it filled my disk at work ;-).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.84  1999/05/19 23:02:01  set<br>
<li> Added: Some QBasic keywords to the BASIC shl. Contributed by Endlisnis
<s257m@unb.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.83  1999/05/19 22:57:06  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the editor doesn't hang if you load a file with lines multiple
of 0x10000. The editor now refuses to load such a files. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<br>
<li> Added: A message when the editor is interrupted with Ctrl+Alt+Break.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.82  1999/05/16 22:27:36  root (set)<br>
<li> Added: another .env file for Linux, it have more interesting settings
(dynamic executable, no debug information, no warnings, linking with
installed libPCRE and libZ, etc.). But I keep the other because is more
bulletproof.<br>
<li> Modified: the linux.faq because now Alt+8 doesn't generate 8 if the window
8 isn't there.<br>
<li> I did a lot of enhacements to the Linux screen, keyboard and mouse stuff.
For details consult the Turbo Vision change.log.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.81  1999/05/13 00:41:52  root (set)<br>
<li> Modified: As Linux lacks access(name,D_OK) (bad, bad) I added a function
called IsADirectory in pathtool. It checks: (1) name exists, (2) name is
type directory and (3) user have execute access (it means user can use this
directory).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.80  1999/05/12 23:57:30  set<br>
<li> Fixed: In the errors parser absolute paths starting with / where
missinterpreted.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.79  1999/05/12 00:03:15  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Removing a secondary InfView from the list of windows produced a
SIGSEGV or SIGILL because the same object was released twice.<br>
<li> Fixed: When a secondary InfView was released it released the BookMark so:
a) The rest of the InfViewer lost it. Most probably what Brett Porter
<blp01@uow.edu.au> experimented and that I tried to avoid in revision 1.78.
b) At exit when the main InfViewer was destroyed the BookMark was destroyed
again producing a SIGSEGV.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.78  1999/05/11 23:08:22  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Looks like even when I taked all the precautions to avoid having an
unitialized BookMark in InfView there is some way to achieve it so I added
yet another check.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.77  1999/05/11 22:49:51  set<br>
<li> Added: Now people switching from djgpp v2.01 to v2.02 won't get "Can't open
libc.inf" for projects where the libc.inf file was opened. Basically now
InfView will try to find libc.info if libc.inf isn't there (same for any .inf
file). Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au> experimented such a problem.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.76  1999/05/06 03:51:56  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now the clock reduces the size of the menuBar instead of just
overlapping it. It didn't have any sense before, but now I added some code
to the menuBar that enlarge the space between items if there are enough
space so reducing the menuBar size could change the situation, in fact does
it when using spanish menues.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.75  1999/05/06 00:34:41  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Some stuff in gettext library. When I added a free() call to the
library to avoid leaks reports I didn't realized that when LANGUAGE and
other environment variables aren't defined gettext uses static strings that
makes free crash under plain DOS (Not W9x).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.74  1999/05/04 03:03:47  set<br>
<li>> I added some stuff related to a macro Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca> was trying
to do I also implemented some stuff I discussed with MDaniel
<mdaniel@balug.org.ar> some time ago.<br>
<li> Added: RunProgramRedir sLisp command, it runs an external program and
redirects stderr and stdout to a file, the file is then returned as a string
variable. That's ultra powerful (and dangerous ;-).<br>
<li> Added: WordUnderCursor sLisp command, it returns the word under the cursor.
Useful for external help and things like that.<br>
<li> Added: ShowInSatusLine sLisp command, it shows an string in the status
line. Useful to show results to the user.<br>
<li>> Now from the internal side:<br>
<li> Modified: The RunExternalProgram function to get some flags that controls
the redirection. I added it to the rhideint.cc file, but the functionallity
is not implemented in RHIDE.<br>
<li> Added: RunExternalProgramGetFile to get the redirected file. I also added
a dummy to rhideint.cc so it won't break the compilation, but is a dummy.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.73  1999/05/01 16:02:07  set<br>
<li> Added: Quotation of <rogerh40@aa.net> in the windos.faq about problems with
VShield.<br>
<li> Fixed: Short cut for "Regula expressions" was the same used for "Global" in
the "Replace" dialog. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.72  1999/05/01 14:39:24  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When pressing end in a line that contained only tabs the editor was
positioning the cursor at the end of the tabs but the visible cursor was
positioned in the first column producing a confusing effect.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.71  1999/05/01 01:01:32  set<br>
<li> Added: Code to detect if SET_FILES point to an invalid point and in this
case try to guess the right value and if it fails inform it and stop.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if the syntax highlight file can't be loaded the editor doesn't
derreference a NULL pointer (SHLArray).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.70  1999/05/01 00:00:26  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if TMPDIR isn't defined or is wrongly defined the stderr/stdout
redirection doesn't fail so easilly. Now I try with %TEMP%, %TMP%, /tmp, c:/
or .<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.69  1999/04/30 23:06:38  set<br>
<li> Added: Greek fonts. I'm in the middle of a big change in the code page
stuff that will take some weeks.<br>
<li> Fixed: "Home" button when no tcedit.dst was loaded (it used uninitialized
data).
.<hr>v0.4.25 8th public release. Uploaded to DJ's server (Simtelnet), my home
page, BALUG home page, LUGAr, sent to Ivan, announced in Freshmeat and
Linuxberg.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.68  1999/04/21 23:07:13  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Was not possible to load files with []=+, or ; from the open dialog
even when LFNs where available. The problem was in TV. Reported by
Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<br>
<li> Fixed: The check for files modified after running an external program was
wrong, I don't know why I was checking the creation time instead of the
modification time. It also affected the Save with same time. I discovered it
while processing some code pages with Perl scripts from inside the editor
(using the run external program feature).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.67  1999/04/18 23:33:44  set<br>
<li> Changed: Now I use PCRE v2.04 for the Perl Regular Expressions. I was using
v1.07 of feb 1998, the new one is dated feb 1999.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.66  1999/04/18 22:14:55  root (set)<br>
<li> Applied changes to the Debian files from Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.65  1999/04/18 22:08:46  root (set)<br>
<li> Changed: Now the Linux version is also compressed with UPX.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.64  1999/04/18 21:57:29  root (set)<br>
<li> Updated: The Linux installation script, now the text will tell the real
default prefix (is stuffed by the Perl script), the text of the VCSA.SH
script and the FAQ to reflect the current condition.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.63  1999/04/18 21:50:16  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if a syntax highlight indicates that the "escape" character is
also a symbol it isn't displayed in red. That's the case of Perl where the
\ can be used outside strings.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.62  1999/04/18 21:40:40  set<br>
<li> Changed: to UPX 0.70 and -9 compression. Tried --best but is too slow and
doesn't help the editor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.61  1999/04/18 21:32:16  set<br>
<li> Added: A workaround for a bug in the Windows 95 clipboard handling. Looks
like the Windows 95 clipboard can't receive an arbitrary number of bytes for
the clipboard (int 0x2F service 0x1703), instead you must (a) enlarge the
number to be a multiple of 32 and (b) ensure the string is padded with 0s. If
you pass a 32*n bytes string without doing it you kill the application that
pastes the text. How said W95 is idiot? nah.... I found it after crashing
Pegasus various times.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.60  1999/04/16 02:28:31  root (set)<br>
<li> Updated the linux.faq it had hints about things that no longer apply.<br>
<li> Added: a file called version.txt to hold the number of the last release.<br>
<li> Updated the INSTALL.LINUX because it had wrong information about the
default prefix.<br>
<li> Updated the readme.1st to reflect the last changes and explain some Linux
specific stuff.<br>
<li> Added: -f to the rm calls in Makefile to avoid error in the clean target.<br>
<li> Modified: the compress scripts to use the version.txt.<br>
<li> Removed the ../mp3/libamp.mak <-> rhide.env dependency from the makefile.<br>
<li> Fixed: some wrong wording abour the default prefix in the makes/readme.txt.
Reported by Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.59  1999/04/13 01:09:25  set<br>
<li> Added: Syntax highlight for Phyton. Contributed by David
<david.stegbauer@cz.opel.com>.<br>
<li> Added: A micro FAQ to the DOS version.<p>

> The bugs and leaks will remmember this battle for years ;-))
  I was hunting memory problems (malloc/free, out-of bounds and leaks) with
YAMD by Nate Eldredge <nate@cartsys.com>. Was just to make sure the editor
was clean. I was working in it five days, as a result:<br>
<li> Various destructors of TVision were modified to release the allocated
memory.<br>
<li> I patched gettext library to release the allocated memory.<br>
<li> Modified djgpp libc to release the atexit linked list. The patch was
incorporated to the 2.03 WIP.<br>
<li> Heavilly modified YAMD 0.23 to ignore allocations from putenv, __alloc_file
and _invent_inode.<br>
<li> Added code in many places to release the allocated memory at exit, some of
these places are: a destructor for TCommToMacroCol and TMLIBase, a new class
called TLispConstString to replace a static TLispString, hook in fstrcmp and
many UnLoad... calls to routines that releases memory.
  With these things I managed to get a 0 leaks report from YAMD and using it
I found:<br>
<li> An out-of bounds read in the copy of the fonts data to the transfer buffer.
It could become dangerous in the future.<br>
<li> A leak in the EasyDiag destructors.<br>
<li> A leak in the calculator dialog (use of delete instead of destroy).<br>
<li> A leak in the functions list when no functions were found or you exited
with ESC.<br>
<li> Powered Grep didn't delete the passed "word under cursor".<br>
<li> A potentially important leak in the undo of the TCEditor class. The editor
wasn't deleting it in the destructor.<br>
<li> A leak in flushUndo (not killing the already used by undo cells).<br>
<li> A leak in the rectangular blocks, propietary clipboard not deleted in the
destructor.<br>
<li> A leak when clearing a rectangular selection.<br>
<li> A leak when copying to the rectangular selection clipboard and using undo
plus redo.<br>
<li> A leak in the "Screen Options" dialog (list of fonts not released).<br>
<li> A leak in the project window (items not released when closing the project.
Use of delete and not destroy).<br>
<li> Another leak when deleting items from the project.<br>
<li> A leak in the "Tip of the day" dialog (destroy).<br>
<li> A leak in the syntax help search (not releasing the word under cursor).
  Also and thanks to the heavy use of the memory when using YAMD I found:<br>
<li> Fixed: Bug in insertBuffer failed when the buffer reallocation moved the
base of the buffer and then we tried to undo this action.
  In the middle time:<br>
<li> Fixed: When a file had 0 bytes it was reported as read error.<br>
<li> Fixed: When the editor failed to load a file it wasn't inserted in the
desktop but was inserted in the ALT+0 list producing a GPF/SIGSEGV when
asking for the list of windows. Reported by "Dean Limbaugh"
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us> (a Linux user).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.56  1999/04/02 18:49:51  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Character 0xD0 in "IBM PC 850" code page.<br>
<li> Fixed: Character 0xD8 in "IBM PC 852" code page.<br>
<li> Changed: Some names of the code pages to be more clear.<br>
<li> Added: Full documentation for the layout of my fonts with Unicode
equivalence. I used tables that Fojtik Jaroslav <FOJTIK@vision.felk.cvut.cz>
sent me to do the job.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.55  1999/04/02 15:16:00  root (set)
Many things related only to the Linux version:<br>
<li> Now the executable is called setedit and the installer creates a symlink
called e. That's more similar to DOS where I use e.bat.<br>
<li> Changed: Now the docs are compressed with -9. (Ivan).<br>
<li> Changed: The installation is to /usr by default now. (Ivan).<br>
<li> Added: Search for files in /usr and not only /usr/local tree. (Ivan).<br>
<li> Fixed: The message about wrong installation now displays ok. (Ivan).<br>
<li> Fixed: ALT+F5 now waits for ENTER.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.54  1999/04/01 23:24:50  set<br>
<li> Changed: Now Optimal Fill doesn't use a tab when only one space can be used.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.53  1999/04/01 22:56:19  set<br>
<li> Added: A new target to the makefile called clean-docs to remove all the
generated docs. Suggested by Ivan Baldo.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.52  1999/04/01 22:46:26  set<br>
<li> Added: A key to stop the DOS version, that's Right Shift+Control+Delete.
That's just a test, don't know if that's definitive.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.51  1999/04/01 22:16:15  set<br>
<li> Applied the -2 and -3 diffs for the Debian package files from Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.50  1999/04/01 21:48:00  set<br>
<li> Added: History to the "Goto line" dialog. Suggested by Fojtik Jaroslav
<FOJTIK@vision.felk.cvut.cz>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.49  1999/04/01 20:02:09  set<br>
<li> Changed: The name of the editor's help. As the editor is officially called
setedit is sensible to call the help file setedit.info and the language file
setedit.mo (I changed it too). It was suggested by Ivan Baldo to avoid
potential problems with the Debian alternatives which could create a symlink
editor.info -> default_editor_name.info. It wasn't a simple change because
just changing it all the old users will get "Can't find 'editor' help" when
loading old desktop files. So I added an obscure feature: if the editor loads
an old desktop file and it makes reference to a editor.info that's changed
to setedit automagically. I know it could be bad, but will help in 99,99% of
the cases.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.48  1999/04/01 18:56:36  set<br>
<li> After fixing my monitor (was a problem in the PCB, very silly, hard to
find) I starting with the todo list of the day ;-) [the monitor was
manufactured in march of 1991 ... and then I must read posts in the list
about trashing three years old equipment ...] Added: a configuration variable
to the .env files to setup the directory for the support headers. In this
way you can use installed libraries instead of the provided ones. Requested
by Ivan Baldo for the Debian package.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.47  1999/04/01 01:25:57  set<br>
<li> Added: Now you can enter a VESA mode in the "Screen Options" to use
something like 132x60 (mode 0x10C). The fonts doesn't work (at least in my
board). I added it because Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com> asked about
it.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.46  1999/04/01 00:06:03  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if you save the undo behaves taking in count that the
"unmodified" copy is now the one on disk. Reported by Thiago F.G.
Albuquerque <thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.45  1999/03/31 23:31:27  set<br>
<li> Added the libset.mak and other two .mak files to the source distribution
because now Robert integrated the new version of the editor to RHIDE and
people that needs to compile RHIDE without having RHIDE needs this .mak.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.44  1999/03/31 23:15:49  set<br>
<li> Added: The "Set Global Options" is now available even if no editors are
opened. Is funny that I already designed all to support it (static class
members) but never implemented it until a couple of users pointed it as a
bug.<br>
<li> Fixed: Now if no editor windows are opened the "Set Local Options" command
is disabled. This and previous were reported/suggested by: Robin Y. Millette
<millette@bigfoot.com> and Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.43  1999/03/31 22:47:44  set<br>
<li> Added: a key mapping for cmcSmartUnIndent, I lost it when I did the new
keyboard handling. Additionally I fixed some wrong explanations about this
command found in the docs. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.42  1999/03/31 22:26:02  set<br>
<li> Fixed: a problem with the manifest file, it contained distrib/ as prefix
for all the files and made impossible the uninstall making "rm @manifest/..."
Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.41  1999/03/31 22:07:08  set<br>
<li> Bug killed: GetDefaultScreenSaver() was returning a pointer to a static
string and then in the Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General I was deleting this
string. This bug was reported by different persons under different
situations: Joerg Jungermann <Joerg_Jungermann@accident.cpp.de>, Ivan Baldo
and Adam Schrotenboer <ajschrotenboer@lycosmail.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.40  1999/03/25 00:29:11  set<br>
<li> Added the first Debian files from Ivan.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.39  1999/03/23 00:45:10  set<br>
<li> Changed: all the references to libtv.a to librhtv.a in the gprs because I
changed the name of the library.<br>
<li> Changed: Now the rhide.env file defines TVISION_INC as the directory where
the Turbo Vision headers are located. That's needed for the Debian package.
Before I was defining TVISION pointing to the place where the sources are
located, but in Debian the sources doesn't need to be installed, just the
binary package.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.38  1999/03/22 23:45:40  set<br>
<li> Fixed: a bug that prevented the use of Linux desktop files under DOS. It
was very silly but is in all the older versions. The editor was saving a
random palette and when used in DOS the result was unpredictable (normally a
black palette). Now the Linux version saves the BIOS default palette.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.37  1999/03/22 23:07:52  set<br>
<li> Killed a bug in Tool&Ops|HTML Accents, I forgot to reload the base pointer
of the buffer and it can be changed while inserting text. I found this bug
while writing HTML pages about my vacations (the reason of no changes in
weeks ;-)
.<hr>v0.4.24 7th public release. Bug fix release.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.36  1999/02/22 01:58:45  set<br>
<li> Changed version number and updated readme.src.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.35  1999/02/22 00:06:07  set<br>
<li> Fixed a bug that made the editor crash while loading desktop files older
than v0.4.20. Introduced by the 1999/02/07 12:55:02 change. From reports of
Robin Y. Millette <millette@bigfoot.com>, Luis Pistoia <lu5gpl@arnet.com.ar>
and Martijn Versteegh <VERSTEEGH@KVI.nl><br>
<li> Enhanced the syntax highlight support for .BTM files. Additions by Robin
Y. Millette <millette@bigfoot.com>.<br>
<li> Applied a patch by Andris to librhutil, just to be syncronized because this
function isn't used from this library.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.34  1999/02/18 02:38:33  set<br>
<li> Compiled with djgpp v2.02 and gcc 2.8.1. Removed the files needed to patch
djgpp 2.01.
<hr>v0.4.23 6th public release, sources and binaries uploaded to DJ's server,
announced in the djgpp mailing list, binaries and sources uploaded to my
home page and sources and binaries of the Linux version uploaded to my
home page. (edi0423s.zip is around 1Mb).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.33  1999/02/16 22:04:41  set<br>
<li> Changed make by $(MAKE), the first fails in DOS.<br>
<li> Added "hurry" chapter to readme.src.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.32  1999/02/15 23:09:07  set<br>
<li> Added more information in readme.src, mostly details.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.31  1999/02/15 22:54:19  set<br>
<li> Added a #error stop point in the libamp sources to warn the user if is
trying to use Allegro 3.0.<br>
<li> Added more instruction to compile the editor without MP3 support.<br>
<li> Added a check in the DOS' compress.pl to see if the make of the docs
was successful.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.30  1999/02/15 22:33:11  set<br>
<li> Fixed fromunix.pl and added a cp call to copy the djgppenv.env file as
rhide.env. Similar change in the fromdos.pl.<br>
<li> Some clarifications in the readme.src (Perl needed for installation).<br>
<li> Added an 'editor' target to the make file (make -f editor.mak), made it the
default target, made distrib and install depend on the 'editor' target.<br>
<li> Added a -f to the rm calls in REMOVE_UNNEEDED to avoid a lot of messages
from rm, added deletion for /usr and /usr/local locations.<br>
<li> Added a check for gzip, makeinfo and successfully docs creation in the
Linux's compress.pl. Added change.log.gz.<br>
<li> Added quick instructions to compile the editor in the readme.txt.<br>
<li> Updated the distribution readme.1st and announce (distrib1.txt and
distrib2.txt) to reflect the last changes.<br>
<li> Fixed: a strong bug in the editor, it was possible to select text outside
the buffer if the last line didn't contain an end of line marker. Even when
it looks harmless if you tried to delete a block with this 'feature' the
editor generated a SIGSEGV.<p><br>
<li>------- Tagged this point as ivan0423 and sent a copy to Ivan Baldo -------*<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.29  1999/02/15 00:20:45  set<br>
<li> Modified: Now when the editor loads a default desktop file (not from the
current directory or a project) the default load, save, etc. points are
ignored. That's important for people that uses only one centralized desktop,
if I don't do it the editor will remmember the last point where s/he saved
the file and this is very confusing.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.28  1999/02/14 23:52:34  set<br>
<li> Added code to setup the tabs colors to a default for all desktop files
where the value is 0.<br>
<li> Added a default for the tabs in the mochrome palette.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.27  1999/02/14 23:06:46  set<br>
<li> Added the make install target to Linux.<br>
<li> Added 'prefix' and 'install' parameters to the Linux compress.pl file.<br>
<li> Changed: Now InfView by default searchs the info files in /usr/local/info
and then in /usr/info.<br>
<li> Modified the INSTALL.MAK file to handle the 'prefix' much better.<br>
<li> Changed: Now the usage is printed to the stderr.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.26  1999/02/14 20:48:35  set<br>
<li> Added 'prefix' facility to the DOS compress.pl, using --prefix PREFIX, or
the environment variables PREFIX and prefix.<br>
<li> Added 'install' facility to the DOS compress.pl.<br>
<li> Added install target to the makefile.<br>
<li> Changed the contrib/setedit directory by contrib/setedit.bin in the binary
distribution.<br>
<li> Updated the year in the about box.<br>
<li> Added explanation about the new targets in the readme.txt.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.25  1999/02/14 15:23:32  set<br>
<li> Updated the copyright year (1999).<br>
<li> Updated my telephone number, ugh! now is huge.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.24  1999/02/14 14:11:38  set<br>
<li> Added help for the new edition modes, the file open dialog and other things.<br>
<li> Fixed some typos in the help and menues.<br>
<li> Changed all the cmbXXXX references in the help by cmcXXXX.<br>
<li> Added context sensitive help to more menu entries, fixed for others.<br>
<li> Added context sensitive help to most of the dialogs.<br>
<li> Enabled SDG (was accidentally disabled in the 0.4.22/23 snapshots).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.23  1999/02/13 15:17:16  set<br>
<li> Added an example of menu configuration called redmond.smn, WinCrap users
should like to try it. Triggered by a suggestion of Thomas Knudsen
<tk@gfy.ku.dk> to use Ctrl+Tab for next window.<br>
<li> Fixed: a problem in my v2.01 libc copy (no in the original) that messed
some things when ^C was pressed. I don't know if it affected a public release
of the editor.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.22  1999/02/12 22:52:45  set<br>
<li> Incorporated the last version of librhutil from Robert and applied the
patches I did and forgot to tell Robert.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.21  1999/02/12 22:28:19  set<br>
<li> Changed SETFindFile to FindFiles again and did it available only when using
STANDALONE, in this way Robert can overwrite it with your own version.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.20  1999/02/12 22:16:41  set<br>
<li> Fixed: When using Alt+F5 (Show user screen) the editor was polling the
keyboard without calling idle() and hence eating CPU. Reported for RHIDE by
Gili <sl@psycode.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.19  1999/02/11 00:38:50  set<br>
<li> Version 0.4.23 reported by the editor. I already released snapshots of the
editor with the number inside so is time to reflect it in about and in .dsts.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.18  1999/02/11 00:32:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Sometimes when opening a closed window the cursor position even when
restored OK was showed in the wrong position giving a surprise when typing.<br>
<li> Hey! what a night I killed more bugs today than all the bugs killed in
december and january *;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.17  1999/02/11 00:21:08  set<br>
<li> Fixed: Tips of the day was using gmtime instead of localtime. It triggered
the tips at 9:00 pm in my case ;-)<br>
<li> Fixed: The printing routines used gmtime instead of localtime. I fixed it
because I made a global search for gmtime ;-))<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.16  1999/02/11 00:14:35  set<br>
<li> Added support for Windows clipboard in the InfView windows. Suggested by
Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>.<br>
<li> Added a Makefile target called 'distrib' to call the distribution scripts.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.15  1999/02/10 23:38:04  set<br>
<li> Added: Now the command line is more POSIX compliant, well at least supports
short and long commands. I used the GPL'd getopts_long function in DOS
because djgpp lacks this functionallity.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.14  1999/02/10 22:23:58  set<br>
<li> Added: now when "Scroll lock centers" is on the searchs are centered too.
Suggested by SpaZe / ST <stealth.tech@usa.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.13  1999/02/10 01:06:25  set<br>
<li> Fixed the "Compact text" option. Now it doesn't replaces tabs by spaces
when only one space will be replaced. Reported by Andy <andygoth@juno.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.12  1999/02/10 00:35:59  set<br>
<li> Fixed a typo in the tips dialog. Reported by Stuart Hall
<Stuart.Hall@aetna.com>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.11  1999/02/10 00:15:58  set<br>
<li> Added a command line switch to enable the Red Hat 5.2 keyboard mapping
style. Not tested yet (you can see it was under DOS). I found the keyboard
differences with the help of Tom Aschenbrenner <tom@aschen.com>.<br>
<li> Fixed the parsing routines to support strings inside preprocessor lines. An
interesting thing is that a string opened inside a #define extends the
#define. I hope it will work ok. Bug reported by SpaZe/ST
<stealth.tech@usa.net>.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.10  1999/02/09 23:10:28  set<br>
<li> Some fixes in the documentation:
 * Fixed some typos.
 * Added better information about pmacros, was outdated. Suggested by Stuart
 Hall <fprintf@iname.com>.
 * Renamed a chapter that have the same name as other and was hided
 (Miscellaneous).
 * Added better information about the current license (GPL).<br>
<li> Added the copying.* and copyrigh files to the binary distribution.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.9  1999/02/09 00:29:46  set<br>
<li> Added a new mode to the editor called "Don't move inside tabs". When this
mode is on is very hard to put the cursor in the middle of a tab (I hope
quite impossible ;-). When you try to do it the cursor is automagically moved
to the start of the tab character so when you type you don't get surprises.
A lot of people asked about it, here is a small list: "a.meyer"
<hexx3000@schaltzentrale.mvnet.de>, MDaniel <mdaniel@balug.org.ar>, Sinan,
Andy M Goth <andygoth@juno.com>, etc. With this second addition tabs users
will get a big boost ;-)<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.8  1999/02/07 16:48:30  set<br>
<li> Added code to support the new "Try" button in the Color Dialog that I added
to TVision (see the TV package for more information).<br>
<li> Added a new mode to the editor called "See Tabs". It paints the tabs, even
when they are selected. Any similitude to the methode used in killtabs by
Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gah@iname.com> or the Midnight Commander editor is
only coincidence ;-)). Additionally: I hope MDaniel will stop complaining
about what hard is to locate tabs (the same for Andy <andygoth@juno.com>).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.7  1999/02/07 12:55:02  set<br>
<li> Minor fixes to make the code more RHIDE friendly: RSIndicator link request,
Expand...() only in standalone (RHIDE uses your own replacement) and renamed
FindFile to SETFindFile. All from suggestions of Robert after testing the
first snapshot of 0.4.23 with the new directory structure.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.6  1999/01/31 15:37:21  set<br>
<li> Included the LibAmp sources in the package to avoid distributing the
binaries.<br>
<li> Linked with Allegro 3.1 and checked the 16 bits sound and additions to
avoid linking the whole library were incorporated by Shawn (all OK).<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.5  1999/01/29 01:41:44  set<br>
<li> Created the compress.pl Perl script to create the Linux distribution files.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.4  1999/01/26 00:16:52  set<br>
<li> Various small adjusts to compile under Linux.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.3  1999/01/25 23:08:07  set<br>
<li> Modified the name files to use the new Uses_n request for the n() macro.<p>
<b>Revision</b> 1.2  1999/01/19 23:47:24  set<br>
<li> Passed the files to a CVS repository.<p>

<p>Converted to HTML by a simple Perl script &copy; by SET</Body></HTML>
