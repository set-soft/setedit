0. IMPORTANT:

  This is a major release and also a "dot zero" release. So you should expect
big changes and also some annoying side effects. Please be patient and try to
help me to solve any problem. I use the editor every day and compiled using
"Electric Fence", it means that in my system the editor is really stable, but
the editor supports too much systems and options.

  Changes in v0.5.2 (for more details read the change.log file):
[taking last stable release (0.5.0) as reference]
[40 new things and 25 fixes]

New [40 things]:

+ Various [19]

* Word completion. Based on tag files.
* Jump to symbol (not only functions: variables, structures, etc.). Based on
tag files.
* Class browser. Based on tag files.
* An option to control the size of newly opened files. When enabled the
windows tries to avoid overlapping the message and project windows. It was
suggested by Ivan Baldo.
* Every 8 seconds or when we focuse a text window the editor checks if the
copy on disk of the file we are editing changed. When the editor detects the
copy on disk is newer asks for reload. But ...
* If we also modified the copy in memory the editor asks for 4 options:
 1) Load the file from disk, it discards changes in the copy we have on
 memory.
 2) Don't do anything, the user must solve the problem.
 3) Like 1 but the editor invokes diff -u and shows the output.
 4) Like 2 but with diff like in 3.
* Support to porperly display international messages even when changing the
code page used by the editor. The messages are recoded on the fly.
* Color scheme contributed by Juan Diego (bach) Ianelli. Is called "Dark JDI".
* Options to export/import project items using a text file.
* Now you can load a project located outside the current directory.
* Holidays highlight to the calendar. Volunteers to support it for each
country are wanted.
* A dialog to dis/enable any advice dialog (also the Quit + delete warning).
* Made the "Paste Emacs mode" more robust. If the first line is
"#!..." the comment is pasted in the second. If the mode was already
pasted by the editor it is first deleted. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Commands to allow configuring the editor to copy/paste the text in input
lines to/from the OS clipboard.
* Command called cmcJumpLastCursorPos. It works similar to cmcLastPosCur but
uses a different mechanism. I assigned this command to ^Q-P that according to
Alain is the WordStar command for it.
* Command that inserts a new line without moving the cursor nor indenting.
This is the old WordStar ^N command.
* Option to avoid redirecting stdout when running an external program. Useful
for interactive applications that uses stdout.
* cmcCommentIndent/cmcCommentUnIndent now indents the current line if nothing
is selected. Suggested by Thiago.
* Commands to copy from the message window to the OS clipboard. Suggested by
Thiago.

+ Compilation [4]

* The compilation process was simplified and BC++ now can be used to create
Win32 version of the editor with the same facility than gcc.
* Support for makeinfo 4.4 and newer (breaks the old API).
* More detailed documentation for each target.
* Scripts to generate RPMs.

+ sLisp [8]

* loop and exitloop sentences. From Bernd Becker.
* Find command. Contributed by Bernd.
* GetCursorX, GetCursorY and SetCursorXY commands.
* ==, !=, ++ and -- operators.
* (repeat times commands...) from code and ideas contributed by Bernd.
* (= var value) as an alias for (setv ...
* GetSyntaxLang command to find which syntax highlight is in use.
* Two constants to be used by RunProgram. They are for the old option (use
OS/user screen) and the new option to avoid redirecting stdout.

+ Syntax highlight and pmacros [5]

* More python keywords. Contributed by Grzegorz.
* Emacs modes and shell names for CSS, Tcl, Java and Python. Suggested by
Grzegorz.
* SQL emacs modes and keywords. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Made more robust the "shell script" shl detection. It now supports:
"#!.../env command" and "#!.../commandVERSION" (i.e. python2.2). From
Grzegorz suggestions.
* Errors parser for ANT Java Builder. Contributed by Grzegorz.

+ Linux [1]

* Support for UTF-8 consoles (i.e. RedHat 8.0 and 9.0).

+ X11 [1]

* The powered grep now paints the screen more often and shows the busy
indicator.

+ Cosmetic [2]

* Calendar windows can be closed pressing ESC.
* ManView window can be closed with ESC. Suggested by Thiago.



Fixed [25 things]:

+ Fatal  [2]

* When a directory contained a project with a desktop file newer
than the current setedit version and a default desktop file from a version
older than 0.5.0 the editor rejected the new file but preloaded it doing
a mess at the time of loading the old file.
* When doing a search in/outside comments close to the first line you could
get a GPF. Reported by Bernd Becker.

+ Not fatal [12]

* Memory leak in about dialog.
* When jumping to a hit in the message window and the first column contained
a matching [{( and the editor was configure to do match pair on the fly: the
message quickly dissapear.
* When typing at the end of the visible area the editor not always scrolled 8
columns making it slow.
* Tips code tried to jump to editor.inf which is no longer called like it.
* Some problems when doing incremental searches in some list boxes.
* Indentation problems in some pmacros.
* "Intelligent indent" mode needed "Backspace unindents" enabled to work
properly.
* The list of "functions" supports things that aren't strcitly programming
languages, like texinfo sources, for this reason the "space" key should't act
as item selector (can be part of the name in an incremental search).
* When switching from a window with some syntax highlight to another
with a different shl and using Alt+F2 it was common to get a wrong result
because the editor used the old shl.
* The -m command line option was disabled.
* Find whole words and out/inside comments didn't work together. Reported by
Alain.
* Fails in the "Export as HTML" command when some text was selected.

+ Compilation [1]

* Issues with newer gcc 3.x (upto 3.3) versions and BC++ 5.6 (CBuilder 6).

+ sLisp [1]

* The RunProgram command was affected by the options in the configuration
dialog.

+ Linux [1]

* When running an external program and using the "OS screen" the editor made
a complete mess. Only in console.

+ X11 [1]

* Problems using the mouse in InfView windows.

+ Cosmetic [7]

* The main documentation was reviewed and a lot of errors fixed.
* Color names now are coherent, all start with a capital letter.
* Shortcut collision between Copy/paste to/from OS clipboard and file
clipboard options.
* After loading a file from a desktop file with column cursor enabled
it wasn't visible until the cursor was moved.
* When no project is available now the "Powered Grep" avoids using
"search in projects" as default.
* Now when you "Quit" and the warning dialog pops up you can press
Escape to abort the process. Suggested by Alex Lozano.
* + and - should change month in calendar.


  For information about older releases and more read the change.log file.

Note for DOS users:
  %DJDIR% == The content of the enviroment variable %DJDIR%, that's the
  place where you installed djgpp. You don't need to set this variable,
  setting DJGPP is enough.



1. REQUIREMENTS:

* PC 386 compatible or superior computer.
* 2 Mb of memory or more.
* 2.4 Mb of free disk during installation and about 1.5 Mb once installed.
* DOS version 5.0 or posterior or any compatible OS (Win '9x, Win 3.1, OS/2,
MS-DOS, etc.).
Note: A native windows version is available but is just for testing.
or
* Linux with ELF support.
or
* FreeBSD, QNX and Solaris are supported but you'll need to compile from
sources.
* A VGA card.
* DJGPP users normally have it.



2. INSTALL:

  *Important* To use the powered grep you need the grep program installed in
your system. To use the man page viewer you need the man program installed in
your system. Both are found in all Linux systems but not in all DOS systems.
  Starting with v0.4.26 the DOS version of the editor is distributed with an
installer, if you have it just run install.exe and follow the instructions.
If you only have a .zip or .tar.gz file that contains a lot of files continue
reading this chapter.
  The following cases are explained:
  
A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users.
B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users.
C) Installing in Linux.

A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users:
1) Uncompress the file over your djgpp installation in the same way you did
   with the rest of packages.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/djgpp/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/djgpp with the place where you installed djgpp.
   IMPORTANT!! Windows NT (4.0, 2k, XP, etc.) is case sensitive for
   environment variables, avoid defining things like Set_Files.

B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users:
   Attention: If you don't use the installer you must have some basic DOS
   knowledge, including: how to set an environment variable, modify your
   PATH and what is autoexec.bat. If you don't know it use the installer or
   ask a friend.
1) Uncompress the file in any directory you like preserving the directory
   structure. Examples:
    
   unzip edi0426b.zip
    or
   pkunzip -d edi0426b.zip
    or
   using WinZip (be careful to preserve the directories)
   
   For the other sections I'll give examples assuming you uncompressed the
   files in c:/setedit.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/setedit/share/setedit
   
   IMPORTANT!! Windows NT (4.0, 2k, XP, etc.) is case sensitive for
   environment variables, avoid defining things like Set_Files.

   Replacing c:/setedit by the place where you uncompressed the editor.
3) Add the c:\setedit\bin (don't forget to replace c:/setedit by the name
   you used in 1) to the PATH in autoexec.bat.
   Example:

   PATH=.... &lt;= Line already existent in your autoexec.bat
   SET PATH=c:\setedit\bin;%PATH%

C) Installing in Linux:
1) Uncompress the files in /tmp and run ./INSTALL_LINUX. If you want to setup
   the destination directory read the INSTALL_LINUX script. You'll need the
   make tool to run it, that's usually installed.
   Also: the script contains useful information about access rights needed
   to run the editor.
2) If you installed the editor in /usr or /usr/local the following is
   optional:
    
   Define the following environment variable (bash syntax):

   export SET_FILES="/usr/share/setedit"

   Replacing /usr by the prefix you used, example: prefix /opt then the
   editor is in /opt/bin and you must define:
   
   export SET_FILES="/opt/share/setedit"
3) Be sure the directory where setedit binary file is located is included in
   your PATH environment variable.

Note for bash users: the file where (2) and (3) should be defined is normally
called .bash_profile or .bashrc in your home directory.



3. MORE INFO:

  From v0.4.0 the editor doesn't need external files to configure the
keyboard so forget about the old xxx.txt files used in RHIDE 1.4.
  You will need to customize the colors from Various|Options|Colors, the ones
used by default aren't pretty.
  To save the default colors and settings go to the %SET_FILES% (examples:
c:/setedit/share/setedit, c:/djgpp/share/setedir, /usr/share/setedit)
directory, start the editor and set all the options (colors and settings
with Alt-G). Just exit and the editor will save a file called tcedit.dst.
Each time you start the editor in a directory where there isn't any *.dst
file the editor will load this default. Linux users that doesn't have write
access to the /usr tree can create a default in their home directory. In
this case the file should be created in ~/.setedit directory.
  Users that want to have only one tcedit.dst file, and not one in each
directory, must configure it in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General.
  If you are annoyed with the back-up files and .dst files created by the
editor in all the places just exit with Alt+Q and the editor will delete
these files. Also see the options available in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor
General.



4. MP3: [Only in the DOS, Linux and Solaris versions]

  Linux users doesn't need to configure any special thing.
  DOS users:
  The editor supports the Allegro mixing routines with 16 bits of resolution
(I contributed it to the Allegro project because I needed it for the editor).
  If you want to enable it create a file called allegro.cfg with the following
contents:

-------- cut here --------
[sound]
sb_freq = 45454
quality = 1
-------- cut here --------

  Put the file in the same directory where the editor is located.
  It will enable the 16 bits routines and mix with the maximun mixing
frequency.
  Enable it only if you are a fanatic because it will eat your CPU ;-).



5. EXAMPLES:

  SDG Example:

  To test the SDG tool you can uncompress the example.zip file in an empty
directory. Then call the editor with e and follow these steps:

1) Select the menu Project|Open and type test and enter. You'll get a new
project.
2) Press Insert and select the three .cc files pressing enter in each one,
the press ESC. Now you have the project filled.
3) Select Various|Options|SDG Options, and take a look to the selected
options, if you have SET_FILES right all must be Ok, so just press ENTER.
4) Press F9. The message window will appear with some messages.
5) Open the file out.html, it was generated when you pressed F9 (look the
syntax highlight).

  Load the file with any web browser and look the results. If you like it
for your code read the sdg.inf file (from the editor, if you don't know how
press F1 and then Ctrl-H to learn more about the help system).

  sLisp macros examples:

  In addition to the macros included in macros.slp (you can access these
macros from the Macros|Choose menu option) I included another, more simple,
examples in a file called examples.slp. It is located in the same directory
as the rest of the configuration files (/usr/share/setedit,
c:/djgpp/share/setedit, etc.).

  Turbo Pascal 7, also for other non-gnu compilers:

  Andreas Leidner &lt;leidner@gmx.net&gt; contributed some wrapper to call TPC7
from the editor and convert the errors into the FSF format so you can jump to
the function that originated the error from inside of the editor. This
examples is included in the directory where other .zip files are located
(contrib/setedit.bin or texts) and is called calltpc7.zip.



6. LEGAL ISSUE:

  The editor is free software.  It may be used or distributed in any manner
you wish, as long as you do not violate the GPL license.  You can't remove
any copyrigth included in the editor and you can't distribute it without any
of the original files. You will also distribute the sources if you distribute
the binaries. The GPL license is included in the package so read it before
distributing the editor.

  The editor comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; excluding any and all implied
warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  There is no warranty or representation, either express
or implied, with respect to this program, its quality, performance,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk
of using this program is with you.  There will be no liability for special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or resulting from the use
or modification of this program.



7. KEYBOARD PREFERENCES

  The keyboard is fully configurable from the Tool&Ops|Options|Keyboard|Key
assignment menu option. But this configures the keys used only by the editor
windows. The menu keys are defined in a text file with the .smn extension.
The file loaded by the editor for this purpose is called menubind.smn. An
example of how you can alter it to change some stuff is provided and called
redmond.smn, I think you can guess what's the effect of this menu
configuration ;-).
  If you used the installer one of the options offered was about changing
redmond.smn by menubind.smn.



8. KEYBOARD EXTENDER [DOS version only]

  In the contrib/setedit directory you'll find a small program called kextend
that's a very simple TSR (only needs 432 bytes of memory in my system) to
extend the BIOS functionallity.



9.  KEYBOARD FEATURES UNDER X [Linux/UNIX version only]

  Currently the editor runs as a native X11 application. It means the
keyboard is fully supported, even the most bizarre key combinations works.
  Note that some Window Managers reserves some key combinations that are used
by the editor. I recommend Enlightenment as W.M. it uses complex  keyboard
combinations and is also configurable so you can change them to avoid
interference.
  The support for XTerm and Eterm is also very good. I recommend using XTerm
from XFree86 4.x project. So I recommend using it for remote conections,
you'll get much better results making telnet to a remote machine using XTerm
than using the Linux console. If you want to get the best results download
the Turbo Vision sources (http://tvision.sf.net) and look the examples found
in the examples directory, they show how to configure XTerm and Eterm to get
even better results.
