Revision 0.424 1998/11/19 set
* Fixed: The message box wasn't updated when the first message was displayed.

Revision 0.423 1998/11/12 set
* Added: Copy and Paste buttons in the calculator dialog to make it more
evident.

Revision 0.422 1998/11/12 set
* Added: Now InfView shows some progress signs while searching. I added it
because with large info files you could think the editor is hanged.

Revision 0.421 1998/11/12 set
* Fixed: "Powered Grep" handled wrong links to directories because (1) They
can be recursive and (2) We can't return to the previous directory with cd ..
An example is the /usr/linux of my machine where /usr/linux/ncurses points to
/usr/linux.

Revision 0.420 1998/11/11 set
* Fixed: Four errors in editor.tx documentation source that stopped makeinfo
1.68 compiling the HTML docs. Reported by Andris. (Texinfo v3.12).

Revision 0.419 1998/11/11 set
* Fixed: Some stuff in INSTALL.LINUX and other scripts. Suggested by Ivan
Baldo.

Revision 0.418 1998/11/11 set
* Fixed: The Linux version didn't respond to the code page broadcast because
the code was under a #ifdef __DJGPP__. Reported by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

Revision 0.417 1998/11/11 set
* Version 0.4.22 because a new option is saved and I released a couple of
0.4.21 versions (Ivan Baldo and www.linux.org.ar have these copies).

Revision 0.416 1998/11/11 set
* Fixed: A bug in InfView when using local messages larger than the english
version. Patch by Robert.

Revision 0.415 1998/11/06 set
* Added: An option to run external programs switching the screen because if
the external program destroys the screen content the editor won't repaint.

Revision 0.414 1998/11/06 set
* Added: transparent support for gzip compressed files. Currently it only
works OK if the editor is linked with zlib. The compressed files are
decompressed to a temporal because the editor then analize the \r\n or \n
mode. When saving the editor just writes the compressed file using zlib.
(5-6)

Revision 0.413 1998/11/05 set
* Added: support for -\*-mode:C;tab-width:8-\*- (note I escaped * ;-)
settings. In this case the editor will use C syntax highlight and set the
tabSize to 8. So now users can even use it as a feature of the editor.

Revision 0.412 1998/11/05 set
* Fixed: If the file had a fake Emacs like mode signaled with "mode:name", for
example the loadshl.cc itself, the file ends without highlight. Now in this
case the editor tries with the extension.

Revision 0.411 1998/11/04 set
* Added: That's a potential source of bugs but I think is a needed feature:
Now the editor reads the attributes of the file before editing it and after a
save the attributes are restored to this value. In this way hidden DOS files
and executable UNIX files are preserved. The DOS attribute called Archive is
set to 1 *ever* because it means the file changed since the last backup. The
default attributes for Linux are 644, that's the same I got before modifying
the routines so I guess is OK, but it could be an option. Now under DOS
hidden and system files doesn't report a wrong message telling they are
"read-only", that's a feature(?) of djgpp's libc to prevent users writing
system sensitive files but is silly from my point of view. A new member
"mode_t ModeOfFile;" was created to hold this information.

Revision 0.410 1998/11/03 set
* Added: Linux: when Alt or AltGr is pressed the control of the mouse is let
to gpm so the user can use it to copy/paste. Was suggested by various Linux
users because that's what mc does.

Revision 0.409 1998/11/03 set
* Fixed: when selecting "Open Info" button from the InfView control dialog
produced a SIGSEGV under Linux because the editor was trying to write in a
constant string (allocated in code segment).

Revision 0.408 1998/11/03 set
* Fixed: a bug in the match pair repainting that painted wrong text after a
whole redraw was done. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>.

Revision 0.407 1998/11/03 set
* Fixed: updateflags wasn't initialized. I think it was the reason of a blank
character drawed in new files drawed randomly from time to time.

Revision 0.406 1998/11/02 set
* Added: Support for internationalization under Linux using glibc2's gettext.

Revision 0.405 1998/11/02 set
* Fixed: Now the change directory and palette customization menu options
doesn't appear under Linux because they aren't ported. Reported by Ivan
Baldo.

Revision 0.404 1998/11/02 set
* Fixed: The Syntax Help (Ctrl+F1) failed with info files where the node name
is different of the name of the function. That's the case of glibc. Reported
by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

Revision 0.403 1998/11/02 set
* Fixed: The screen savers weren't triggered under Linux in the 0.4.21 alpha.
Reported by Ivan Baldo. *NHP*

Revision 0.402 1998/11/02 set
* Modified: The Linux distribution is in .tar.gz format now. Already planned
and Ivan claimed for it ;-))

Revision 0.401 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: In the InfView when incrementally typing a name of a node if the
currently selected link was 0 (none) the editor was accessing to the -1
element of an array. I saw the crash in Linux and I guess Daniel reported it
before but wasn't able to explain how to reproduce.

Revision 0.400 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: In Linux when pressing Ctrl+RightArrow and editing a DOS file the
editor stopped in the last character of the line (no move to the next).
Reported by Andris Pavenis <pavenis@lanet.lv>.

Revision 0.399 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: A bug when parsing macros.slp: if a function was commented it failed.
(The editor reports the error but RHIDE crashes ?!)

Revision 0.398 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: Now after running SDG the editor checks if any of the files under
edition was modified and asks for reload. Normal case if you are taking a
look to the output file ;-)

Revision 0.397 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: The 9Xx34 video modes. The vertical display end was 480 instead of
476 (14*34). Reported by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>.

Revision 0.396 1998/11/01 set
* Added: Syntax highlight support for 8x51 assembler. Contributed by Alex.

Revision 0.395 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: The tip of the day didn't advance when it was displayed in the
message window. Reported by Alex.

Revision 0.394 1998/11/01 set
* Fixed: a bug in setv sLisp command when an error ocurred in one of the
parameters (crash). Similar to the one killed yesterday.

Revision 0.393 1998/11/01 set
* Added: Documentation for some old sLisp commands that I almost forgot. They
are: left, right, substr, sstr, gstr and setv. And some commands not well
documented: SendCommands, InsertText, defmacro, eval and Operator +.

Revision 0.392 1998/10/31 set
* Fixed: A bug in the sLisp interpreter when the code have errors inside a
eval command that have more than one parameter. The interpreter didn't stop
at the error and followed parsing with the error condition producing a crash.

Revision 0.391 1998/10/31 set
* Added: Documentation for WhichEditor and GetSelection.

Revision 0.390 1998/10/31 set
* Added: A new sLisp command called GetSelection it return the currently
selected text. A user proposed it to get context help from an external
program. Suggested by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.

Revision 0.389 1998/10/31 set
* Fixed: A bug in TestForPropagation accessing 1 line outside the lineLen
array. I put conditionals in other places that makes access to this array
checking the index. It produced a random SIGSEGV in Linux when opening a
string (double quote). Robert detected it and sent a patch but I fixed it in
a different way.

Revision 0.388 1998/10/31 set
* Added (or fixed?): Now the recorded macros can record find, replace and find
again actions. Reported by Burton Radons <loth@gec.net> (CA).

Revision 0.387 1998/10/31 set
* Fixed: A bug in recorded macros introduced by the new keyboard handling
(well, new is just an expression it have 1 year ;-), the command associated
to key strokes recorded wasn't initialized and hence had a random value
producing random fails.

Revision 0.386 1998/10/31 set
* Added: Four new values for the sLisp WhicEditor command (2 path, 3 drive, 4
extention and 5 name without extention). Suggested by Tomas Kouba
<kouba@fzu.cz>

Revision 0.385 1998/10/21 set
* Fixed: A bug in SDG, it failed if one of the project files was opened.

Revision 0.384 1998/10/04 set
* Added: A command line switch to avoid hooking the mouse. It helps to run the
editor under NT.

Revision 0.383 1998/10/01 set
* Fixed: The keypad 4 key wasn't mapped to left arrow in my gkey.cc. Reported
by Gili <sl@psycode.com>.

Revision 0.382 1998/09/30 set
* Fixed(?): A couple of bugs in the undo related to the fact that the editor
purges the extra spaces in the lines. The undo still broken but I think I
won't fix all in 0.4.x but in 0.5.x. There are potential problems when using
tabs. To see the bugs in older versions just open a new C file, type /*,
expand it, undo and see how it crash. The other: open a new file, type a
letter, then a space, enter and try to undo. (Reported by Alex).

Revision 0.381 1998/09/24 set
* Modified: Now the parser that looks for "errors" reported by external
programs is more strict about the line number, it must be :nnnn: or will be
rejected. I did it because "ls -la drive:/file" generates a fake error
pattern.

Revision 0.380 1998/09/24 set
* Modified: Some internal stuff about TMLIEditor to simplify the things. Now I
don't use a callback instead I use static members.

Revision 0.379 1998/09/24 set
* Added: A new sLisp command (WichEditor [n]). It just returns the name of the
current editor. The parameter is currently limited to 0 or 1, 0 returns the
name as-is and 1 without extention. Suggested by Tomas Kouba <kouba@fzu.cz>.

Revision 0.378 1998/09/16 set
* Added: A new command cmcMouseToggle, that's specially designed for Linux, it
just enable/disable the mouse (TMouse::suspend/resume), making that the user
can switch between TVision behavior and default gpm behavior. So disabling
the mouse and pressing the right button you can paste text from gpm or copy
text from the screen to the gpm buffer; then pressing the same key sequence
the mouse is controled by TVision again. Lamentably I didn't found any
clipboard like routine in the gpm.info documentation.

Revision 0.377 1998/09/15 set
* Incorporated v0.4.17 to RHIDE 1.4.5.1 experimentally, for that I made some
adjusts in the editor's code and a couple of patches in RHIDE. Diffs sent to
Robert.

Revision 0.376 1998/09/14 set
* Added: An 'R' to the read-only editors in the Windows List.

Revision 0.375 1998/09/14 set
* Fixed: Paste didn't update the the limit.x value. I think it was the reason
that triggered the bug killed on 13.08.1998.

Revision 0.374 1998/09/14 set
* Modified: Now the main project doesn't use small libraries, instead I'm
using the new RHIDE feature of collecting the .o files living the Project
Name in blank. It saves disk space and helps to integrate the editor with
RHIDE.

Revision 0.373 1998/09/12 set
* Modified: The tool to make the diffs is now a Perl script instead a C++
program the script is a little bit better and smaller but is slow and uses
the file utils too much. Conclution: More flexible, faster to code but
clearly inferior. makediff.cc and makediff.gpr removed from the source tree.

Revision 0.372 1998/09/11 set
* Added: Support for macros from the menu so you can add menu items for
different type of compilations. Suggested by Tomas Kouba <kouba@fzu.cz>.

Revision 0.371 1998/09/11 set
* Added: --help command line option to show the available options.

Revision 0.370 1998/09/11 set
* Added: --project command line option to load an specific project file.
Suggested by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>.

Revision 0.369 1998/09/09 set
* Modified: The internal way the editor calls the TCEditor::editorDialog
member ***** IMPORTANT ***** The member points to the same type of function
but the default dialogs provided in doedidia.cc are called with a different
set of parameters. It must be take in count for RHIDE. More about it in the
doEditDialogLocal function comment in editmain.cc. Was needed to hook the
file overwrite warning to check if the new name belongs to an already opened
file.

Revision 0.368 1998/09/09 set
* Fixed: Under the same situation if you choosing as new name the name of the
file already opened was posible, it created two copies of the same memory and
unsynchronized. Now isn't allowed. The same bug exist in RHIDE.

Revision 0.367 1998/09/09 set
* Fixed: When saving a new file (untitled) if the new name already existed and
you answered NO to overwrite the name was set anyways. So exiting and
entering again you get 2 copies of the same file. I saw it while patching
other stuff.

Revision 0.366 1998/09/09 set
* Fixed: A silly question like that: "The disk copy of is newer, reload it?"
triggered because the file didn't exist on disk (new file). RHIDE have the
same stupid bug.

Revision 0.365 1998/09/09 set
* Sent the patchs of 08.09 to Robert. I think I sent some patches repeated.

Revision 0.364 1998/09/09 set
* Fixed: a bug in the HTML accents (10.08.1998). The editor didn't jump to the
start of the text it could unsinchronize the offset to the first line
displayed in the screen messing the drawing. *NHP*.

Revision 0.363 1998/09/08 set
* Fixed: 1) tfiledia.cc to create an input line (TFileInputLine) of PATH_MAX
characters instead of just 79. 2) tfileinp.cc (TFileInputLine) to copy only
maxLen+1 bytes instead of anything. Bug reported and studied by Andris
Pavenis <pavenis@lanet.lv>.

Revision 0.362 1998/09/06 set
* All TVision patches (10 and 19.08 and 05.09) sent to Robert.

Revision 0.361 1998/09/05 set
* Fixed: A bug in TFileInfoPane that was writing out of the TDrawBuffer::data
member when the path was >= 132 characters. Reported by: Daniel Horchner
<dbjhorchner@hotmail.com>, Patch suggested by: Andris Pavenis
<pavenis@lanet.lv>. As a result the TDrawBuffer module was rewrited.

Revision 0.360 1998/09/04 set
* Added: The editor windows that are read-only have and 'R' in the place where
the modified editors have a star.
***** IMPORTANT ***** I did an internal change, now the editor class doesn't
use a TIndicator, instead uses a TSIndicator. TSIndicators are derivated from
TIndicator but have a pointer to the editor's owner and uses the data
directly. It simplifies the things and gives more power to the indicator. So
I did yet another change in the desktop files. Was hard to support the older
ones because the old indicators are inserted in the Windows and I must remove
and replace the indicator.
Version 0.4.21.

Revision 0.359 1998/09/04 set
* Fixed: a bug in the v0.4.18 desktop files (thanks god this version wasn't
distributed). In these files the last character of the syntax help data was
saved as an integer and then the read routine reads a character. I discovered
it when TSetEditorApp::maxOpenEditorsSame wasn't restored correctly. *NHP*
(it means Never Hit People, that's because the bug was in a non-released
version).

Revision 0.358 1998/09/04 set
* Added: A mechanism to open more than one editor for the same file. The first
opened is read/write the rest are read-only and shows an snapshot of the file
at the time you opened it. Read-only editors can't be modified (at least I
did my best to avoid it ;-) and can't be saved. The number of copies is 1 by
default to emulate the old behavior, but can be modified from the general
options menu. This value (TSetEditorApp::maxOpenEditorsSame) is saved in the
desktop file so the version changed:
Version 0.4.20. (3-4).

Revision 0.357 1998/09/03 set
* Version 0.4.19. Triggered by a new value saved (isReadOnly).

Revision 0.356 1998/09/03 set
* Fixed: I was writing in const chars when remapping the characters of the
stars screen saver. In DOS that's OK, but Linux doesn't allow it because the
strings are located in the CS.

Revision 0.355 1998/09/03 set
* Enabled the code page remaping stuff under Linux. Now is possible to see the
ISO-8859-1 fonts in the screen without messing the frames. That's the final
step of the things done in 18-19.08. (30-31.08).

Revision 0.354 1998/08/28 set
* Added: Inferno 1 and Smoker 1 screen savers for DOS.

Revision 0.353 1998/08/19 set
* Added: Two variants to the ISO-1 code page to match the lat1-16.psf and
lat1u-16.psf Linux fonts. That's the first step toward the support of accents
under Linux. (18-19).

Revision 0.352 1998/08/19 set
* Enhanced the code page support to provide "similars" for codes under 32.
That's needed for fonts like lat1-16.psf provided with Debian Linux. BTW: I
think they are broken by design.

Revision 0.351 1998/08/19 set
* Modified: Three TVision classes (TMenuBox, TIndicator and TRadioButtons) to
support code pages.

Revision 0.350 1998/08/18 set
* Added: 22 new symbols to the fonts to support the things described in the
next lines.

Revision 0.349 1998/08/16 set
* Fixed: Another bug in the keyboard assigment routines. Yes another one not
catched under DOS! Was in the CompactTable routine, a call to memcpy used
"size" as size instead of "aux".

Revision 0.348 1998/08/16 set
* Fixed: The editor was saving the keybind.dat in the share directory instead
of the home directory [Linux specific].

Revision 0.347 1998/08/16 set
* Fixed: a problem in the keyboard assigment routines. The bug was related to
one variable (base) not updated after a realloc and hence becoming an invalid
pointer. It was detected under Linux because in DOS the block wasn't reused
and the content still valid.

Revision 0.346 1998/08/16 set
* Fixed: Now the Linux version generates and uses the same desktop files that
the DOS. I forgot to save/restore the palette information in the Linux
version. It produced a SIGSEGV while loading DOS desktop files. Now v0.4.18
desktop files are compatible (DOS <-> Linux). The Linux version can load
desktop files created with previous Linux versions but not with previous DOS
versions.

Revision 0.345 1998/08/16 set
* Fixed: a problem in the conditional menues (8/8/98). I was adding constant
strings to a collection :-P, Linux free was upset.

Revision 0.344 1998/08/13 set
* Fixed: A problem in Save As UNIX. It used the maximun line width to allocate
a temporal buffer in the stack but this value (limit.x) could be
unsynchronized (is used only for the scroll bars) and in this case the stack
was corrupted. Now I allocate it in the heap and check if the len is enough
for each line, if not I realloc the buffer and adjust limit.x. Reported by
Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>.
Interesting Notes: was an interesting analisis of the trace back collected by
the editor. Additionally Brett didn't lost the changes because the editor
saved the buffer correctly in the error file.

Revision 0.343 1998/08/13 set
* Fixed: The routine that meassure the size of the nodes in InfView. I never
saw a side effect but it had a potential flaw.

Revision 0.342 1998/08/13 set
* Fixed: InfView didn't take in count the last entry of the dir files created
by Debian Linux, these files aren't true info files and hence needs some
special treatment. Reported by Daniel Mizyrycki (mdaniel@balug.org.ar).

Revision 0.341 1998/08/12 set
* Fixed: All the declarations of consts without specifying the type (default
int) that's reported as a warning by egcs (not reported by gcc 2.7.x or
2.8.x). Reported by Andris Pavenis <pavenis@lanet.lv>. Some interesting
things: to do it I did a masive search for 'const' using the grep tool of the
editor I got 910 lines in the message window and I opened 180 files using
ALT+F8 Wow!

Revision 0.340 1998/08/12 set
* Fixed: Now using localtime instead of gmtime for the editor's clock.
(Reported by Laszlo Molnar <molnarl@cdata.tvnet.hu>).

Revision 0.339 1998/08/12 set
* Fixed: The way the editor copy text to the Windows clipboard. Now the
clipboard is first erased and then the text is passed as OEM text instead of
just text. Reported by Endlisnis <s257m@unb.ca>, ideas for solutions by:
Michael Mauch <michael.mauch@gmx.de> and Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.

Revision 0.338 1998/08/12 set
* Fixed: Autoindent didn't take in count the first line of the file. (Reported
by Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>).

Revision 0.337 1998/08/12 set
* Applied a patch from Robert to initialize Extention in SHLSelect of
loadshl.cc.

Revision 0.336 1998/08/12 set
* Fixed: An annoying 'flash' when selecting in a line under edition and the
old selection was hided. This was annoying me since I made the selection work
with messages to avoid reading the shift state.

Revision 0.335 1998/08/11 set
* Modified: Now the default screen saver for DOS>=7.00 (Winshit) is a text
mode screen saver because a user reported problems when the editor switchs to
graphics mode and is windowed. It works 100% ok in most of the machines but
I'm using a safe default. I hate winblows. Problem reported by Brett Porter
<blp01@uow.edu.au> and I saw an strange behavior (just ones) in the Alex's
computer.

Revision 0.334 1998/08/11 set
* Fixed: The progress bar now is "code page" friendly.

Revision 0.333 1998/08/11 set
* Adjusted: Some things in the syntax search. Enlarged the window to choose
the match, now doesn't say that no matchs were found if you cancel and
reduced the length for the info file name.

Revision 0.332 1998/08/10 set
* Fixed: The project window now supports code page remapping.

Revision 0.331 1998/08/10 set
* Fixed: The TListViewer TVision's class to support code page remaping of the
column separator character. Needed for the project window.

Revision 0.330 1998/08/10 set
* Added a tool to convert accented characters to HTML tags. The editor used
the HTML entities like Oacute. The tool takes in count the selected code page
so it will work ala WYSIWYG. For example: The oacute of PC437 is the cents
symbol in ISO-1 so if you call the tool while 437 is selected you'll get
&oacute; but if you do it while ISO-1 is selected you'll get &cent;. I need
it for my pages in spanish ;-) (9-10).

Revision 0.329 1998/08/09 set
* Fixed a bug in the ISO-1 fonts. The editor was using &reg; for both &reg;
and &copy; (HTML notation).

Revision 0.328 1998/08/08 set
* Added "Save As DOS" for Linux isn't very well tested, just tried and seems
to work.

Revision 0.327 1998/08/08 set
* Added shortcuts for Grep and jump to function in the menu. Added various
menu entries just to show the key to make the action and help new users.
Added labels with the keys assigned to various commands specially in
"Rectangle". Various changes in the menues. Jump to Function suggested by
Brett Porter <blp01@uow.edu.au>. Local/Global edition options repeated in
Options suggested by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>

Revision 0.326 1998/08/08 set
* Added a primitive conditional support in the menu files to define menu
options dependent of the OS.

Revision 0.325 1998/08/02 set
* Added support for HP laser printers. Now the initialization string created
by the HP button works with: LaserJet 4L, 5M, DeskJet 500+, 560C, 670 and I
guess most of the Laser/DeskJet modern models. Problem reported by "Roger H."
<rogerh40@aa.net>, solutions by: Roger, Mariano Alvarez Fernandez
<malfer@teleline.es> and me.

Revision 0.324 1998/08/01 set
* Added syntax highlight for Perl submited by Daniel Mizyrycki
(mdaniel@balug.org.ar).

Revision 0.323 1998/08/01 set
* Added a progress bar in InfView, displayed when InfView loads a large index
(20 seconds for rbint).

Revision 0.322 1998/07/30 set
* Added syntax help to the editor. (27-30). Similar to the RHIDE but with many
improvements: Sort by score, a dialog to set up the list of nodes to search,
information about the number of nodes from each file, etc.

Revision 0.321 1998/07/30 set
* Killed a bug in InfView introduced by the modifications made 17.06.1998. In
seekToNode(const char *Name).

Revision 0.320 1998/07/26 set
* Applied parser v0.66 from Laszlo. It now supports expression,x to convert
the expression into hexadecimal notation (o=octal, d=decimal and b=binary).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision 0.319 1998/07/21 set
* Version 0.4.17. 5th public release. Diffs sent to Robert. Linux release
available in the web.

Revision 0.318 1998/07/19 set
* Fixed: The powered grep under Linux because it uses response files (not
supported by bash). Now the editor writes an script and runs the script ;-)

Revision 0.317 1998/07/19 set
* Now the editor restores the ALT+Fn console keys when it dies under Linux. I
added a call to suspend_keyboard() in the routine that handles the hard
signal.

Revision 0.316 1998/07/19 set
* More adjustments in the places where the files are stored when running under
Linux. Now the editor's enviroment variables are stored in ~/.setenvir.dat.
The readme.1st file is loaded from SET_FILES.

Revision 0.315 1998/07/19 set
* The @0 marker in pmacros now can be placed in a position where there is no
text (for example because the editor will purge the spaces at the end of
line). It was the cause of a bug in Linux: after expanding a pmacro like "#d"
the cursor was moved to the next line and another bug in DOS: the cursor was
positioned in the \r. I don't know how dangerous was the DOS bug because I
never saw the side effect but looks like a bad one. (Now the @0 is stored as
an X,Y coordinate).

Revision 0.314 1998/07/18 set
* Killed a bug in the "Match pair highligth" option. When typing three
consecutive symbols one weren't correctly un-highligthed.

Revision 0.313 1998/07/18 set
* Added a new sLisp command to call external programs. The syntax is:
(RunProgram "prg1;prg2;..."). It calls the program/s specified, captures the
stderr and show the errors in the message window. With that the user can
assign any program to any key. It was added because a comment of Tomas Kouba
<kouba@fzu.cz> about the need of running different makefiles from the same
project. To avoid conflicts with RHIDE the function that calls the external
program is part of the editor and a dummy is provided in rhideint.cc. Robert:
you should fill the body of this dummy with a call to a function that makes
this work inside RHIDE. Note: The editor currently capture stderr AND stdout,
so all is callected. As an example I did a vey simple macro that shows the
contents of the current directory using "ls -la".

Revision 0.312 1998/07/18 set
* Added support for Emacs style syntax highlight selection. Added because a
request of Gili <sl@psycode.com> about the fact that new C++ standards (dead
brain ones) specify headers without extentions. For this reason now Boolean
TCEditor::loadFile() takes a parameter, Boolean setSHL, when true the
function sets the syntax highlight searching for -*- SHL name -*- in the
first Kb and the last 3Kb of the file as Eli suggested (Emacs behavior), if
that isn't found the extention is used. The only place where loadFile is
called in this way is in the constructor. By default the parameter is False
making the function call compatible with previous versions. The other place
where the SHL is set automatically is in the SaveAs member. Additionally I
added support for some strange files (from SGI and HP found in GNU C++
libraries) that uses a "mode:C++" keyword. The editor uses the list of
extentions as valid modes so I added "C++" as an extention (see syntaxhl.shl
file).

Revision 0.311 1998/06/17 set
* Various modifications in the paths used to load/store the configuration
files under Linux. Mainly: now the user saves in your home hidden files and
the editor looks first for these files and then in the share directory. Not
tested.

Revision 0.310 1998/06/17 set
* Modified the Linux version to open the redirected stderr file in the home
directory instead of the share. (Suggested by Laszlo).

Revision 0.309 1998/06/17 set
* Fixed a bug in InfView. It was jumping to nodes of similar names in DOS
files (fade_interpolate v.s. fade_in in Allegro 3.0 info). It was because
both pass a test with strncmp(s1,s2,strlen(s2)). (Reported by Gili).
