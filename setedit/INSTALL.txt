  Read this file to know how to install from sources.

  The editor have an unified methode to compile for all the available
platforms. But even with it I give separated instructions for each target.
  The first step is to get a copy of Turbo Vision library, last version
available, and compile it. Even when you don't need to install Turbo Vision
in order to compile the editor in some cases you'll need to install Turbo
Vision to run the editor. You can unpack the Turbo Vision files in any
directory but I recommend to unpack the files in a directory located at the
same level as setedit sources. Example: if the editor files are located in
the /usr/src/setedit directory then the Turbo Vision files should be located
in the /usr/src/tvision. Just unpack both packages in the same directory and
let them put their files in setedit and tvision dirs.
  Note: Turbo Vision site is http://tvision.sf.net/

  Here are the files that describes how to compile for each target:
  [alphabetically sorted]

Borland C++ (5.5, 5.6)                    doc/install/bcc.txt
CygWin                                    doc/install/cygwin.txt
DJGPP (2.02, 2.03)                        doc/install/djgpp.txt
Linux                                     doc/install/linux.txt
Microsoft Visual C (5.0, 6.0, 7.0)        doc/install/msvc.txt
MingWin                                   doc/install/mingwin.txt
UNIX (POSIX) systems                      doc/install/unix.txt

  Important: If you want to contribute to this project you can help me to
keep any of these targets working. You just need to get the CVS changes
periodically compile and tell me if it worked or not.
