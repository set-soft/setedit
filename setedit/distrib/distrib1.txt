0. IMPORTANT:

  This is a major release and also a "dot zero" release. So you should expect
big changes and also some annoying side effects. Please be patient and try to
help me to solve any problem. I use the editor every day and compiled using
"Electric Fence", it means that in my system the editor is really stable, but
the editor supports too much systems and options.

  Changes in v@@v@@ (for more details read the change.log file):
[taking last stable release (0.4.54) as reference]
[41 new things and 25 fixes]

* Now is possible to indicate a project to load without the extension in the
command line.
* Option to generate HTML 4.01 + CSS in the HTML export.

line is already indented, if not the operation is aborted.
* Now the matchpair and the complementary element jumps are affected
by the syntax highlight.
* An LRU algorithm to remove entries in the closed list.

* Option to save a desktop file in the current directory.
* Independent set of options are stored for each driver used (DOS, Linux,
X11, etc.) in the desktop files.

+ InfView/ManView [3]

* Ctrl+Arrows support.
* Support fot copy from man page to: editor's clipboard, main OS clipboard
and secondary OS clipboard.
* The default ManView colors as suggested by Ivan, now they are more coherent
with InfView.

+ List of functions [2]

* If two identical functions (most probably only one is really used at compile
time) both are listed in the list of functions.
* PHP functions parser. Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>

+ Run external programs and message window [4]

cursor under X11).


Fixed [25 things]:

+ Fatal  [5]

* SIGSEGVs when using "Tool&Ops|Options|Run program" when no desktop file was
loaded.
* Buffer overflow in temporary names created by infview (L_tmpnam).
* When starting the editor with a remmembered file that no longer
exists located in a directory where we don't want backups the editor
removed the dektop structure from the list and inmediatly used it.
* Crash in InfView when no desktop file was available.
* Some problems that made the editor crash when opening a file from
the windows list dialog and this process needed to show a messageBox.

+ Not fatal [12]

* A bug in InfView parser. When a node had a lot of cross references
that started in a line and ended in another *and* the last cross reference
was near to the end of the node *and* the hide options were enabled.
* Code generated for a recorded macro now uses \t instead of an ASCII 9
embedded in the string.
* The show match pair on the fly without waiting had an interaction with the
syntax highlight computation.
* C++ operators parsing in the list of functions.
* When browsing the list of errors and selecting an error reported
in a non-existant file the editor opened an empty buffer.
* When the editor fails to load a desktop file (wrong version,
corrupted file, wrong access rights, ect.) the editor tries to load the
global desktop file.
* One preprocessor combination that fooled the functions parser.
* When typing in overwrite mode the line length was wrongly computed.
* The editor didn't allow to save ReadOnly files using "Save As".
* The selection adjust done when we leave a line under edition failed if the
line had extra spaces at the end.
* Now when choosing to "never remember windows" the options "resume" isn't
applied.
* When indenting a block using the arbitrary indent or comment indent the
syntax highlight wasn't recomputed.

+ Undo [1]

* Bug in the undo of text typed while using overwrite mode.

+ DOS [3]

* The installer now uses cwsdpmi and a regular stub (much more reliable than
pmodedj).
* Ctrl+Break is now blocked.
* When using the editor without djgpp the editor failed to find the
internationalization files.

+ Cosmetic [4]

* The ASCII window grown after a window resize.
* "Shell" instead of "DOS shell".
* Error in docs about delete left/right word.
* When restoring the settings of a closed window (or project item) the
"overwrite" status wasn't reflected in the cursor shape.

  For information about older releases and more read the change.log file.

Note for DOS users:
  %DJDIR% == The content of the enviroment variable %DJDIR%, that's the
  place where you installed djgpp. You don't need to set this variable,
  setting DJGPP is enough.



1. REQUIREMENTS:

* PC 386 compatible or superior computer.
* 2 Mb of memory or more.
* 2.4 Mb of free disk during installation and about 1.5 Mb once installed.
* DOS version 5.0 or posterior or any compatible OS (Win '9x, Win 3.1, OS/2,
MS-DOS, etc.).
Note: A native windows version is available but is just for testing.
or
* Linux with ELF support.
or
* FreeBSD, QNX and Solaris are supported but you'll need to compile from
sources.
* A VGA card.
* DJGPP users normally have it.



2. INSTALL:

  *Important* To use the powered grep you need the grep program installed in
your system. To use the man page viewer you need the man program installed in
your system. Both are found in all Linux systems but not in all DOS systems.
  Starting with v0.4.26 the DOS version of the editor is distributed with an
installer, if you have it just run install.exe and follow the instructions.
If you only have a .zip or .tar.gz file that contains a lot of files continue
reading this chapter.
  The following cases are explained:
  
A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users.
B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users.
C) Installing in Linux.

A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users:
1) Uncompress the file over your djgpp installation in the same way you did
   with the rest of packages.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/djgpp/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/djgpp with the place where you installed djgpp.
   IMPORTANT!! Windows NT (4.0, 2k, XP, etc.) is case sensitive for
   environment variables, avoid defining things like Set_Files.

B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users:
   Attention: If you don't use the installer you must have some basic DOS
   knowledge, including: how to set an environment variable, modify your
   PATH and what is autoexec.bat. If you don't know it use the installer or
   ask a friend.
1) Uncompress the file in any directory you like preserving the directory
   structure. Examples:
    
   unzip edi0426b.zip
    or
   pkunzip -d edi0426b.zip
    or
   using WinZip (be careful to preserve the directories)
   
   For the other sections I'll give examples assuming you uncompressed the
   files in c:/setedit.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/setedit/share/setedit
   
   IMPORTANT!! Windows NT (4.0, 2k, XP, etc.) is case sensitive for
   environment variables, avoid defining things like Set_Files.

   Replacing c:/setedit by the place where you uncompressed the editor.
3) Add the c:\setedit\bin (don't forget to replace c:/setedit by the name
   you used in 1) to the PATH in autoexec.bat.
   Example:

   PATH=.... <= Line already existent in your autoexec.bat
   SET PATH=c:\setedit\bin;%PATH%

C) Installing in Linux:
1) Uncompress the files in /tmp and run ./INSTALL_LINUX. If you want to setup
   the destination directory read the INSTALL_LINUX script. You'll need the
   make tool to run it, that's usually installed.
   Also: the script contains useful information about access rights needed
   to run the editor.
2) If you installed the editor in /usr or /usr/local the following is
   optional:
    
   Define the following environment variable (bash syntax):

   export SET_FILES="/usr/share/setedit"

   Replacing /usr by the prefix you used, example: prefix /opt then the
   editor is in /opt/bin and you must define:
   
   export SET_FILES="/opt/share/setedit"
3) Be sure the directory where setedit binary file is located is included in
   your PATH environment variable.

Note for bash users: the file where (2) and (3) should be defined is normally
called .bash_profile or .bashrc in your home directory.



3. MORE INFO:

  From v0.4.0 the editor doesn't need external files to configure the
keyboard so forget about the old xxx.txt files used in RHIDE 1.4.
  You will need to customize the colors from Various|Options|Colors, the ones
used by default aren't pretty.
  To save the default colors and settings go to the %SET_FILES% (examples:
c:/setedit/share/setedit, c:/djgpp/share/setedir, /usr/share/setedit)
directory, start the editor and set all the options (colors and settings
with Alt-G). Just exit and the editor will save a file called tcedit.dst.
Each time you start the editor in a directory where there isn't any *.dst
file the editor will load this default. Linux users that doesn't have write
access to the /usr tree can create a default in their home directory. In
this case the file should be created in ~/.setedit directory.
  Users that want to have only one tcedit.dst file, and not one in each
directory, must configure it in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General.
  If you are annoyed with the back-up files and .dst files created by the
editor in all the places just exit with Alt+Q and the editor will delete
these files. Also see the options available in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor
General.



4. MP3: [Only in the DOS, Linux and Solaris versions]

  Linux users doesn't need to configure any special thing.
  DOS users:
  The editor supports the Allegro mixing routines with 16 bits of resolution
(I contributed it to the Allegro project because I needed it for the editor).
  If you want to enable it create a file called allegro.cfg with the following
contents:

-------- cut here --------
[sound]
sb_freq = 45454
quality = 1
-------- cut here --------

  Put the file in the same directory where the editor is located.
  It will enable the 16 bits routines and mix with the maximun mixing
frequency.
  Enable it only if you are a fanatic because it will eat your CPU ;-).



5. EXAMPLES:

  SDG Example:

  To test the SDG tool you can uncompress the example.zip file in an empty
directory. Then call the editor with e and follow these steps:

1) Select the menu Project|Open and type test and enter. You'll get a new
project.
2) Press Insert and select the three .cc files pressing enter in each one,
the press ESC. Now you have the project filled.
3) Select Various|Options|SDG Options, and take a look to the selected
options, if you have SET_FILES right all must be Ok, so just press ENTER.
4) Press F9. The message window will appear with some messages.
5) Open the file out.html, it was generated when you pressed F9 (look the
syntax highlight).

  Load the file with any web browser and look the results. If you like it
for your code read the sdg.inf file (from the editor, if you don't know how
press F1 and then Ctrl-H to learn more about the help system).

  sLisp macros examples:

  In addition to the macros included in macros.slp (you can access these
macros from the Macros|Choose menu option) I included another, more simple,
examples in a file called examples.slp. It is located in the same directory
as the rest of the configuration files (/usr/share/setedit,
c:/djgpp/share/setedit, etc.).

  Turbo Pascal 7, also for other non-gnu compilers:

  Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net> contributed some wrapper to call TPC7
from the editor and convert the errors into the FSF format so you can jump to
the function that originated the error from inside of the editor. This
examples is included in the directory where other .zip files are located
(contrib/setedit.bin or texts) and is called calltpc7.zip.



6. LEGAL ISSUE:

  The editor is free software.  It may be used or distributed in any manner
you wish, as long as you do not violate the GPL license.  You can't remove
any copyrigth included in the editor and you can't distribute it without any
of the original files. You will also distribute the sources if you distribute
the binaries. The GPL license is included in the package so read it before
distributing the editor.

  The editor comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; excluding any and all implied
warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  There is no warranty or representation, either express
or implied, with respect to this program, its quality, performance,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk
of using this program is with you.  There will be no liability for special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or resulting from the use
or modification of this program.



7. KEYBOARD PREFERENCES

  The keyboard is fully configurable from the Tool&Ops|Options|Keyboard|Key
assignment menu option. But this configures the keys used only by the editor
windows. The menu keys are defined in a text file with the .smn extension.
The file loaded by the editor for this purpose is called menubind.smn. An
example of how you can alter it to change some stuff is provided and called
redmond.smn, I think you can guess what's the effect of this menu
configuration ;-).
  If you used the installer one of the options offered was about changing
redmond.smn by menubind.smn.



8. KEYBOARD EXTENDER [DOS version only]

  In the contrib/setedit directory you'll find a small program called kextend
that's a very simple TSR (only needs 432 bytes of memory in my system) to
extend the BIOS functionallity.



9.  KEYBOARD FEATURES UNDER X [Linux version only]

  If you want to use the editor under X I recommend installing Eterm 0.8.10
and follow the instruction found in the readme.txt file located in the eterm
directory of the configuration files (example:
/usr/share/setedit/eterm/readme.txt). Using it you'll get all the available
keyboard combinations (some of them are used by the Window Manager and
aren't accesible, I recommend Enlightenment as W.M. it uses complex  keyboard
combinations and is also configurable so you can change them to avoid
interference).
  I uploaded sources of Eterm 0.8.10, the patches needed to generate a Debian
package and my patches to enable the special keyboard mode to Source Forge.
You must install the sources and apply both sets of patches, finally compile
and install the package. For those using Debian Potato I also uploaded
binaries in .deb format. All is in the extra section of the Source Forge site:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/
  If you use xterm you'll experiment some limitations imposed by common UNIX
terminals, example: Shift+Arrows reported just as arrows.
  The Linux FAQ included in the distribution explains some common problems.
