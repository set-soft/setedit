0. IMPORTANT:

  Like the old releases I'm testing new features and bug fixes, some of them
will be part of RHIDE so I need them tested.

  Changes in v@@v@@ (for more details read the change.log file):

New [23 things]:

* Configurable mechanism to parse the errors collected from an external
application. It uses Perl RegEx to do the job. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now you can pass extra command line options using an environment variable
called SET_CMDLINE.
* Menu option to save the project manually. Suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
* Project window also says the name of the project file. Suggested by Jeremy
W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Command line option +[line number], like in VI. Suggested by Ivan.
* When calling the man page viewer the editor offers the word under cursor
as man page.
* Shl flag "EscapeAnywhere" this switch makes the editor parse the escape
character outside strings.
* Syntax highlight for PLM/51 contributed by Jari Korhonen
<jari.korhonen@ponsse.fi>. (Intel's long-gone not-so-highlevel language for
8051 CPUs).
* Command line switch to specify files to load from an external list of files
where each line is a file. Suggested by SpaZe.
* Three command line switches: --tile-vert, --tile-horiz and --cascade
to make these operations after loading the files from the desktop file or
named in the command line. Suggested by Spaze.
* The reverse operation for "HTML accents". Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now the file open dialog is resizeble. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Yet another tab mode. "Tab indents", it is by default enabled because
that's what the editor ever did. Disabling it the editor will behave like
when using tabs but will insert spaces instead of tabs.

+ Linux

* Debian package for InfView.
* ISO-8859-1 spanish messages.
* InfView man page. Pointed out by Ivan,
* Now the convert HTML accents feature also works in Linux, was just matter
of enabling it.
* Now the editor disables the Xon/Xoff mode of the terminal so ^Q/^S aren't
used for it. It enables the use of ^Q and ^S when running in an Xterm, Eterm,
etc.

+ DOS

* Now the editor also looks for HOME and HOMEDIR when loading configuration
files. Also: the directory where the exe is located is the one looked at last.

+ Cosmetic:

* Now the message window shows ^M if the line contains /r.
* Changed the way the INFOPATH is guessed under DOS. A djgpp user installed
the editor outside the djgpp tree and then the editor used INFOPATH but
failed to find the setedit.inf file. Now the editor also adds your tree even
if INFOPATH is defined. Reported by Sylvia <smlew@ifocus.com.sg>.
* Now if you use "load only specified files" the editor doesn't really load
the files to then close'm like before. It makes things faster.
* Now the new option to search the word when you press ^F1 inside
the node takes the visible name you choose from the list and not the word
under cursor. Suggested by Gregorio.


Fixed [10 things]:

* Problems with info files created with the new Texinfo 4.0 package.
* Abort when pressing ENTER in the message window without items.
* Bug in sLisp when handling strings with escape sequences (\n, \t, etc.).
Reported by Uwe Steinmann <steinm@majestix.fernuni-hagen.de>.
* GPF/SIGSEGV when using BackSpace in the functions list to delete the first
letter in the incremental search. Reported by Gregorio.
* Crashes when starting the editor and it was playing an MP3 file that doesn't
exist anymore.

+ Linux:

* Problems when saving files in DOS format. Reported by Gregorio.
* When switching from hidden to normal desktop files the editor left the
hidden version of the desktop file generating potential confusions. Now the
hidden file is removed.

+ DOS:

* Problems with project files. Reported by Ryan Owen <ryan@eyring.com>.

+ Cosmetic:

* The ~K~eep short-cut in the SDG options was used for O~K~. Reported
by Gregorio.
* When inserting items to the project the editor used the *.epr mask instead
of the one used to open regular files. Reported by Gregorio.



  Changes in v0.4.39 (v.s. 0.4.35)

New [43 things]:

* Now the pseudo macros can be selected from the menu. It helps people to
learn what pmacros are available.
* An option to export the text as HTML but without using colors.
* A check to see if the current directory is valid. Using bash you can
easilly delete the current directory and be "in the land of nowhere".
* A configure/make/make install mechanism.
* cmcPushCursorPos and cmcPopCursorPos. They use a 12 levels (11 usable)
circular stack.
* cmcToggleCharCase "This is vi's '~' command -- it toggles the case of
the char under the cursor". Added to menu, also added block to upper/lower.
Both additions were suggested by Thiago F.G. Albuquerque
<thiagofga@ambr.com.br>.
* Now the file dialog stores the path in the history even if you abort. It
also remmembers the last mask used. Suggested by Pavlos.
* Full list of Spanish messages. Also fixed some menu and dialog messages
while testing the Spanish messages (cosmetic stuff).
* Now the editor pass to external screen savers a file handle for a
file that contains the screen contents. It allows external screen savers
based on the current screen contents. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now is possible to indicate that EOLComment1 must be in the first column
and EOLComment2 don't.
* Now is also possible to tell to the editor that an EOLComment is valid if
it's located in the first non-blank character. Seems to be needed for TCL.
Suggested by "FireEgl (Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Now is possible to associate a SHL with a file name using regular
expressions (PCREs). You can give regex to match the file name or the whole
path+name. It is needed for things like makefiles and was asked by Ivan and
Gregorio. (NameMatch and FullNameMatch).
* A rudimentary SHL for Makefiles.
* Jump to prototype command. That's very similar to jump to function.
Suggested by Pavlos.
* Now if you double click over name(section) construction in a man page
window the editor jumps to this manpage. Suggested by Ivan.
* Code page remaping. It should work for all the supported code pages. Also:
The code page remapping routines converts symbols not found in the
destination code page to similar ones.
* Basic TeX syntax highlight, contributed by Alexander Bokovoy.
* TCL syntax highlight, contributed by FireEgl <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Wrapper example for collecting Turbo Pascal 7.0 errors. Contributed
by Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net>.
* DOS Greek keyboard support (code page 737). Requested by Pavlos to make
accelerators work in both, english and greek, modes.
* Support for the following code pages: Latin: DOS 775, 857, 861; UNIX 8859-3,
8859-4, 8859-9, 8859-14, 8859-15; Windows 1250, 1252, 1254, 1257 Cyrillic:
KOI-8 CRL, ISO-IR-111/153/146/147, Mac CP10007 (and Ukraininan variant),
U-Code R, KOI-7, Osnovnoj Variant Russian, Alternativnyj Variant RU. Greek:
DOS 737, 869; Windows 1253 and UNIX 8859-7 A total of 27 code pages!
Pavlos and Alexander Bokovoy provided information for greek and cyrillic
code pages.
* Now when jumping to a line with errors the editor ever highlights it and
also shows the error in the status line.
* When an external program returns errors the editor jumps to the first line
in the message window. Also, the editor adds a message to know the control
is back again in the editor.
* Now the example of macro from menu is now more useful, it pop-ups a
dialog and you can enter a command, the output of this command is inserted at
the cursor position. Ivan asked for such an option from the menu.
* Redraw command to the editor (in menu and documented).
* Now kextend license to Public Domain so Debian purist can't complain.
* Now the linux.faq is also installed in the docs directory as faq.txt.
* A new command to decode "quoted printable" text. I need it to demangle
spanish mails in MIME format.
* A new indentation command that allows to indent with any arbitrary text.
I need it to quote parts of mails (usually using "> ").
* An option to make InfView search the word under cursor when you did a
syntax search, but inside the selected topic. Hmmm... how to explain it,
just use ^F1 and see. Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>
* Now you can use double click to select an item in the ^F1 list of hints.
Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
* Now the Alt+F2 functions search can search C++ operators too. I hope it
didn't break other thing ;-). Asked by Andris.

+ DOS:
* MP3's ID3 genre field to the MP3 dialog. "Pavlos" <gtoub@otenet.gr>
provided the first 100 names and I added another 42 from WinAmp 1.90.
* The emu387.dxe emulator so the editor can be installed in systems without
coprocessor. Suggested and tested by "Eathan Clark" <eathan@cableone.net>.
* A new editor command called cmcCutClipWin to cut text to Windows clipboard.
Suggested by Spaze. I also mention it in the documentation and give an
example in redmond.smn about how to use the Windows clipboard instead of the
internal one.

+ Linux:
* Some documentation about the mouse. Suggested by Ivan.
* The no/overwrite status is showed in the indicator (at the right of the
modified star). Suggested by Dean Limbaugh <edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us>.

+ sLisp:
* Constants for WhichEditor to avoid "magic numbers", documented.
* GetSyntaxAtCursor command to know if the cursor is inside a comment,
a preprocessor line or a string. Suggested by Endlisnis.
* New command: ForceUpdate asked by Endlisnis.
* New command: ShortFileName. Needed to pass SFNs to external programs.
Requested by Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net> to pass files to Turbo Pascal
7.0.
* New command: AskString, it pop-up a dialog asking for user input.
* Now the sLisp InsertText function doesn't allow the insertion of text with
\n and not \r\n under DOS (not well tested).


Fixed [38 things]:

+ Serious:
* The calendar object was pretending to be an ASCII table so when its
window was closed it didn't remove yourself from the list making Alt+0 to
crash. Reported by "Jeremy W. Murphy" <jwm@amc.com.au> and "Pavlos"
<gtoub@otenet.gr>.
* The Info and Help buttons of the Screen Savers setup window were ever
enabled and generated SIGSEGVs if used for internal screen savers.
Reported by Gregorio. Also by Ilker Aksen <Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* A crash when a file failed to load [only seen in Linux]. Reported by
Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>.
* One bug in the code page/fonts handling. Deleting a font twice.

+ Not so serious:
* A couple of bugs in the "delete file from disk" feature of the windows
list.
* Preprocessor lines that included a comment were drawn with an ASCII 0 at
the end of the line. That's usually invisible, but not when using ISO-LAT1U
fonts.
* The editor was trying a partial match for a reserved word before to check
for a full match with a user reserved word. It could be experimented only
with the Texinfo shl; I noticed it while updating the docs.
* InfView didn't paint the first match in a search across a file that forced
a node switch, other matchs in the same node were painted.
* InfView left the match selection on after a node switch and was visible
until the cursor was moved.
* InfView was giving the same priority to partial matchs and perfect matchs
when the partial appears first. (in search best match member).
* The cmcForceMatchPairHL command was recorded when recording macros from
keyboard so the length of the macro was enlarged without gaining any
functionallity, now is filtered.
* When Alt+F2 didn't find any function it said No instead of Ok in the dialog.
Reported by Jeremy.
* When Match Pair and Wrap Columns were enabled and the match happened in the
wrap column the editor did really stupid things.
* The "Test" button in screen savers dialog only worked if the screen
saver was ON before entering in the dialog. Reported by Spaze.
* When adding new user words they wasn't visible until the next redraw,
that's forced now.
* It was posible to save a block with the name of an opened file. Even when
the editor issued a warning about overwriting a file it could have bad
side effects.
* When pasting in input lines not all the text was selected and the cursor
wasn't well positioned.
* The new special character shl feature wasn't parsed by the
multilines parser, only for the painting parser. Reported by "FireEgl
(Philip)" <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* Now if the message window is outside the screen that's fixed at load
time. I don't really know the reason for it but Gregorio and me experimented
it. Is something related with running the editor with different screen
resolutions. Reported by Gregorio.
* When using a central tcedit.dst file was possible to get the cursor
unsynchronized with the no/overwrite mode. Reported by Grzegorz Adam
Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>.
* I forgot to add infview.mak to the list of makefiles to patch.

+ Linux:
* Now ^C and ^/ are disabled.
* Errors converting DOS files to UNIX format. The result was mixed style
files!
* Save files as DOS could fail.
* The editor didn't read the right keybind.dat file. So defining/undefining
keys under Linux was quite hard.
* If the file had less than 2 bytes it was reported as a read error. Reported
by Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>.
* The editor was creating userwords.txt and default settings in
/usr/share/setedit instead of user's home. Reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* SIGSEGVs when using hidden desktop files. Reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* debian/doc-base was missing in the distribution.
* The editor was creating a tcedit.dst file in /usr/share/setedit if you
selected to save only one centralized file. That isn't correct, this
directory could be read-only. If you want default options to be global for all
the users you can copy tcedit.dst to /usr/share/setedit, but the editor won't
save there; the HOME directory will be used instead. Reported by Ivan.
* Paste in input lines failed. Reported by Ivan.

+ DOS:
* A bug in djgpp v2.02 libc system() function that left child exes opened
leaking file handles and preventing external compilers to overwrite the file.
It only happened for non-djgpp programs. "Andreas Leidner" <leidner@gmx.net>.

+ Cosmetic:
* Various typos in the web page, thanks to Steve Wagor <stevew@uis.net>
* One define in windoldap.h file. Reported by Pavlos.
* An egcs warning (egcs bug) reported by Ilker Aksen
<Ilker.Aksen@astrazeneca.com>.
* Two typos (asigNment). Reported by Spaze.
* Wrong width of the dialog to choose a command. Reported by Spaze.
* A lot of warnings from gcc 2.95, don't know if all (const missing type,
char * not const, assembler clobber lists, etc.).

  For information about older releases and more read the change.log file.

Note for DOS users:
  %DJDIR% == The content of the enviroment variable %DJDIR%, that's the
  place where you installed djgpp. You don't need to set this variable,
  setting DJGPP is enough.



1. REQUIREMENTS:

* PC 386 compatible or superior computer.
* 2 Mb of memory or more.
* 2.4 Mb of free disk during installation and about 1.5 Mb once installed.
* DOS version 5.0 or posterior or any compatible OS (Win '9x, Win 3.1, OS/2,
MS-DOS, etc.). The NT platform isn't fully supported, I don't have NT, if you
need support for NT send me a licensed copy of NT ;-). I did my best to
support it, but as I don't have one at home I can't do more.
Note: A native windows version is available but is just for testing.
or
* Linux with ELF support for the Linux version. For console use you need gpm
1.14, older versions are incompatible.
* A VGA card.
* DJGPP users normally have it.



2. INSTALL:

  *Important* To use the powered grep you need the grep program installed in
your system. To use the man page viewer you need the man program installed in
your system. Both are found in all Linux systems but not in all DOS systems.
  Starting with v0.4.26 the DOS version of the editor is distributed with an
installer, if you have it just run install.exe and follow the instructions.
If you only have a .zip or .tar.gz file that contains a lot of files continue
reading this chapter.
  The following cases are explained:
  
A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users.
B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users.
C) Installing in Linux.

A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users:
1) Uncompress the file over your djgpp installation in the same way you did
   with the rest of packages.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/djgpp/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/djgpp with the place where you installed djgpp.

B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users:
   Attention: If you don't use the installer you must have some basic DOS
   knowledge, including: how to set an environment variable, modify your
   PATH and what is autoexec.bat. If you don't know it use the installer or
   ask a friend.
1) Uncompress the file in any directory you like preserving the directory
   structure. Examples:
    
   unzip edi0426b.zip
    or
   pkunzip -d edi0426b.zip
    or
   using WinZip (be careful to preserve the directories)
   
   For the other sections I'll give examples assuming you uncompressed the
   files in c:/setedit.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/setedit/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/setedit by the place where you uncompressed the editor.
3) Add the c:\setedit\bin (don't forget to replace c:/setedit by the name
   you used in 1) to the PATH in autoexec.bat.
   Example:

   PATH=.... <= Line already existent in your autoexec.bat
   SET PATH=c:\setedit\bin;%PATH%

C) Installing in Linux:
1) Uncompress the files in /tmp and run ./INSTALL_LINUX. If you want to setup
   the destination directory read the INSTALL_LINUX script. You'll need the
   make tool to run it, that's usually installed.
   Also: the script contains useful information about access rights needed
   to run the editor.
2) If you installed the editor in /usr or /usr/local the following is
   optional:
    
   Define the following environment variable (bash syntax):

   export SET_FILES="/usr/share/setedit"

   Replacing /usr by the prefix you used, example: prefix /opt then the
   editor is in /opt/bin and you must define:
   
   export SET_FILES="/opt/share/setedit"
3) Be sure the directory where setedit binary file is located is included in
   your PATH environment variable.

Note for bash users: the file where (2) and (3) should be defined is normally
called .bash_profile or .bashrc in your home directory.



3. MORE INFO:

  From v0.4.0 the editor doesn't need external files to configure the
keyboard so forget about the old xxx.txt files used in RHIDE 1.4.
  You will need to customize the colors from Various|Options|Colors, the ones
used by default aren't pretty.
  To save the default colors and settings go to the %SET_FILES% (examples:
c:/setedit/share/setedit, c:/djgpp/share/setedir, /usr/share/setedit)
directory, start the editor and set all the options (colors and settings
with Alt-G). Just exit and the editor will save a file called tcedit.dst.
Each time you start the editor in a directory where there isn't any *.dst
file the editor will load this default. Linux users that doesn't have write
access to the /usr tree can create a default in their home directory. In
this case the file should be created in ~/.setedit directory.
  Users that want to have only one tcedit.dst file, and not one in each
directory, must configure it in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General.
  If you are annoyed with the back-up files and .dst files created by the
editor in all the places just exit with Alt+Q and the editor will delete
these files. Also see the options available in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor
General.



4. MP3: [Only in the DOS and Linux versions]

  Linux users doesn't need to configure any special thing.
  DOS users:
  The editor supports the Allegro mixing routines with 16 bits of resolution
(I contributed it to the Allegro project because I needed it for the editor).
  If you want to enable it create a file called allegro.cfg with the following
contents:

-------- cut here --------
[sound]
sb_freq = 45454
quality = 1
-------- cut here --------

  Put the file in the same directory where the editor is located.
  It will enable the 16 bits routines and mix with the maximun mixing
frequency.
  Enable it only if you are a fanatic because it will eat your CPU ;-).



5. EXAMPLES:

  SDG Example:

  To test the SDG tool you can uncompress the example.zip file in an empty
directory. Then call the editor with e and follow these steps:

1) Select the menu Project|Open and type test and enter. You'll get a new
project.
2) Press Insert and select the three .cc files pressing enter in each one,
the press ESC. Now you have the project filled.
3) Select Various|Options|SDG Options, and take a look to the selected
options, if you have SET_FILES right all must be Ok, so just press ENTER.
4) Press F9. The message window will appear with some messages.
5) Open the file out.html, it was generated when you pressed F9 (look the
syntax highlight).

  Load the file with any web browser and look the results. If you like it
for your code read the sdg.inf file (from the editor, if you don't know how
press F1 and then Ctrl-H to learn more about the help system).

  sLisp macros examples:

  In addition to the macros included in macros.slp (you can access these
macros from the Macros|Choose menu option) I included another, more simple,
examples in a file called examples.slp. It is located in the same directory
as the rest of the configuration files (/usr/share/setedit,
c:/djgpp/share/setedit, etc.).

  Turbo Pascal 7, also for other non-gnu compilers:

  Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net> contributed some wrapper to call TPC7
from the editor and convert the errors into the FSF format so you can jump to
the function that originated the error from inside of the editor. This
examples is included in the directory where other .zip files are located
(contrib/setedit.bin or texts) and is called calltpc7.zip.



6. LEGAL ISSUE:

  The editor is free software.  It may be used or distributed in any manner
you wish, as long as you do not violate the GPL license.  You can't remove
any copyrigth included in the editor and you can't distribute it without any
of the original files. You will also distribute the sources if you distribute
the binaries. The GPL license is included in the package so read it before
distributing the editor.

  The editor comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; excluding any and all implied
warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  There is no warranty or representation, either express
or implied, with respect to this program, its quality, performance,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk
of using this program is with you.  There will be no liability for special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or resulting from the use
or modification of this program.



7. KEYBOARD PREFERENCES

  The keyboard is fully configurable from the Tool&Ops|Options|Keyboard|Key
assignment menu option. But this configures the keys used only by the editor
windows. The menu keys are defined in a text file with the .smn extension.
The file loaded by the editor for this purpose is called menubind.smn. An
example of how you can alter it to change some stuff is provided and called
redmond.smn, I think you can guess what's the effect of this menu
configuration ;-).
  If you used the installer one of the options offered was about changing
redmond.smn by menubind.smn.



8. KEYBOARD EXTENDER [DOS version only]

  In the contrib/setedit directory you'll find a small program called kextend
that's a very simple TSR (only needs 432 bytes of memory in my system) to
extend the BIOS functionallity.



9.  KEYBOARD FEATURES UNDER X [Linux version only]

  If you want to use the editor under X I recommend installing Eterm 0.8.10
and follow the instruction of the readme.txt file located in the eterm
directory of the configuration files (example:
/usr/share/setedit/eterm/readme.txt). Using it you'll get all the available
keyboard combinations (some of them are used by the Window Manager and
aren't accesible, I recommend Enlightenment where all the keyboards are
complex and also configured so they doesn't interfere).
  I uploaded to Source Forge the sources of Eterm 0.8.10, the patches
needed to generate a Debian package and my patches to enable the special
keyboard mode. You must install the sources and apply both sets of patches,
finally compile and install the package. For those using Debian Potato
I also uploaded binaries in .deb format. All is in the extra directory of
the Source Forge site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/
  If you use xterm you'll have some limitations imposed by common UNIX
terminal, example: Shift+Arrows reported as just arrows.
