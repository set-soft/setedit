  Like the old releases I'm testing new features and bug fixes, some of them
will be part of RHIDE so I need them tested.

  Changes in v@@v@@ (for more details read the change.log file):

vs 0.4.41
1.290 vs 1.386

New [things]:

* Transparent support for bzip2 compressed files (text and info files).
Suggested by Salazar <jsalaz3@almez.pntic.mec.es>.
* New calculator parser from Burton Radons. It adds conditionals, variables
definitions and function definitions.
* Now is possible to have two files with the same file name in projects if
they are different files (from different directories). After some talk with
Grzegorz.
* Now the list of functions lists members like this "member (class)" instead
of C++ syntax "class::member". It makes the incremental search much more
simple.
* A dialog asking if a compressed file saved with "save as" should be
also saved compressed. Reported by Grzegorz.
* German traslation for most of the messages. Contributed by Oliver Schieche
<oliver.schieche@d2mail.de>.
* When the user have one central desktop file the editor makes a
back-up of it before writing a new one. This is quite useful for Windows
systems that likes to crash and corrupt files. Suggested by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* When a file that was stored in the desktop file no longer exists the
editor doesn't open an empty window. Suggested by Martijn Versteegh
<m.versteegh@hccnet.nl>
* A button to the file open/save/etc dialog to configure the sorting options.
* New options to hide .*/*~/*.bkp and sort .* to the end to the dialog to
configure the file open dialog.
* Modified the behavior of Paste from Win Clipboard to be consistent with
what a regular windows user would expect.  Now it just does not copy the
previous selection to the clipboard and selects the pasted text only if
persistent blocks are enabled. Patch from Anatoli Soltan
<anatoli@iname.com>.
* Now the "Open only specified files" option is divided in various
options to give more control about what is stored in the desktop file. Now
the windows are divided in three types: Editor, Non editors and Closed
Editors. For each group is possible to set if we want to: remmember it,
remmember it but if the command line contains file names forget or just
don't remmember. These nine options replaces the old one.
* An option to not remmember the cursor position while loading the desktop.
* Now File Open dialogs not only remmembers paths+masks but also file names
(full qualified).
* The number of lines of the saved text (not only size).
* A new option to avoid making backups for some particular files. The setting
is just a list of regex (Perl style) stored in a text file. If a file name
matches any of the regex the editor doesn't create a backup.

+ Configuration

* Configurable status line, so now the accelerators shown at the bottom of
the screen are configurable. Suggested by Dean Limbaugh
<edl@ns1.co.alachua.fl.us> and Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de>.
* Now the $if command supports and/or operators for menu files.

+ InfView

* Real support for Texinfo 4.0's Ref: references. They jump to the correct
node and positions the cursor at the right line.
* InfView now looks in all the file if the node isn't found in the first try.
It helps for handedited/damaged info files.

+ List of functions

* A button to the function list called "Browse". It sends the list of
functions to the message window sorted alphabetically or by line number and
then you can browse the source code jumping from function to function.
Suggested by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz <gradha@iname.com>.
* Support for Clipper, Perl and SHL functions in Alt+F2.
* An option to the search dialog to show the name of the function where a the
text was found.

+ Run external programs and message window

* Now is possible to enter comands upto 256 characters long in the run
external program dialog (was 80).
* Now the messages/errors from the external program can be parsed in
background. Is slower but you can continue working. That's the default
when the command runs in parallel, but can be enabled even if the process
will block the editor.
* Options to configure how often the Message Window is updated when
the messages are parsed in parallel with the child program (the parameter
is how many lines are processed before releasing the CPU to poll input
devices). Also to configure if the window is forced to scroll or not.
* A new option to the Run program options dialog. When enabled and we get
errors from the child process the editor jumps to the first line with errors.

+ Edition modes

* Yet another tab option: Now is possible to indent using spaces but
also using an indentation ammount different than the tab size. The new option
is called "Use indent size" and you can also configure the value of "indent
size". Suggested by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.
* Now tab size, indent size and wrap column are stored for closed files and
project items.
* Don't purge spaces options. When enabled the spaces at the end of lines
aren't automagically deleted by the editor. Suggested by Martijn Versteegh
<versteegh@kvi.nl>.
* Now backspace behavior is not tied to the Real Tabs option. It have your
own option.
* A new option that forces the editor to do the match pair 'on the fly'
without waiting for idle. Suggested by Oswald Buddenhagen
<ob6@inf.tu-dresden.de>.

+ Editor commands

* Jump to last column in screen. Suggested by Leon <Leon@caresystems.com.au>.
* A new command called cmcWhichFunctionIs. It determines the name of
the function where the cursor is positioned. It isn't associated to a key.
Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy.
* CommentIndent command, it indents a block with the EOLCom1 definition.
Suggested by Thiago.
* CommentUnIndent, it unindents a block using the length of EOLCom1 as
reference. Suggested by Thiago.
* Code page remap for a block of text (no the whole file). It have undo and I
reused code from toupper/lower block.
* Block invert case and alternate case.

+ Sound system

* The MP3 list can be loaded/saved as a WinAmp M3U list.
* Board level sound mixer. With options to disable it from command line
(--no-mixer). Under DOS only SB Pro and SB 16 compatible mixers are supported.
Under Linux OSS mixer is supported. The values can be optionally stored in
the desktop file.
* Support for MP3s inside wavs, damaged MP3 files, VBR encoded files with a
modified version of the mpegsound library (splay).

+ Syntax highlight and pmacros

* SQL. Contributed by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Objetive C. Contributed by Beni Cherniavsky <cben@crosswinds.net>.
* PDP 11 assembler. Contributed by Beni Cherniavsky <cben@crosswinds.net>.
* .po files.
* PostScript. Contributed by S. M. Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* JavaScript. Contributed by S. M. Halloran <mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* Cascading Style Sheets v2. Contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* More tags to the HTML syntax highlight contributed by S. M. Halloran
<mitch@duzen.com.tr>.
* Now the keywords of the syntax highlights aren't loaded at start-up,
intead they are loaded on demand. The keywords and the search tables are the
most memory consuming parts of the syntax highlight structure. Is possible to
force the load of some of them at startup.
* A couple of new pmacros for Clipper.
* Now all modes are supported in the Mode setence used by the pmacros.

+ sLisp

* OpenFile: opens a file as a new window. (Asked by "Thiago F.G. Albuquerque"
            <tfga@zaz.com.br>)
* length: returns the length of a string.
* strcasecmp/strcmp: compares strings.
* Operator -: for integers.

+ Linux

* MP3 support.
* Palette support.
* A shell option. I ever thinked it wasn't a good idea but a user asked for
it. Suggested by David Xu <davidx@viasoft.com.cn>.
* The run external program option now can run the program in background. It
can optionally disabled by the user.
* The background process can be stopped just selecting the Message Window and
pressing Ctrl+C. The status line indicates if that's available or not (the
process is running or we still parsing their output).
* Now the editor also dumps a stack trace when crashes. I also added a
message informing the user where the unsaved buffers and crash information
can be found.
* Two new behaviors in case of a crash. One calls gdb to get a detailed stack
trace and information about local variables the other not only does it but
also gives the control to gdb so we can get more information. If we are in a
X a separated xterm is created for gdb. Based in code by Bjorn Reese
<breese@mail1.stofanet.dk> sent me by Grzegorz. It can be selected from the
command line and with an environment variable.
* Now when expanding compressed info files the temporal file is removed just
after opening it. Making it we don't let those temporals when the editor
crashes or we debug it.
* Now the editor loads ~/.file first that ~/file for any configuration file.

+ Windows

* Window title for W9x adding information about the version and loaded
project. Suggested by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.

+ Cosmetic

* Now double clicking in Alt+0 window is the same as pressing the Go button.
Suggested by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* An horizontal scroll bar to the MP3 list dialog.
* The list of functions and list of windows now have horizontal scroll bar.
* All the Turbo Vision messages to the translations.



Fixed [things]:

* A small error in the MSVC errors parsing. Pointed out by Grzegorz.
* The error pattern description for Borland C compilers. Now it works
for BC++ 5.5. Reported by Grzegorz.
* ESC doesn't reset the palette to defaults in the palette dialog. Reported
by Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* GPFs produced by the column and row cursors when the cursor was outside the
visible area, also uninitialized data.
* When loading .dst files older than 0.4.32 the memorized flags for closed
files were converted in the wrong way. Some times enabling the cross cursor.
* When using the match pair on the fly the editor always forced a line
flush even if the cursor weren't in a potential match. Now that's done only
if the cursor is over {, }, (, ), [ or ]. A side effect of this behavior was
reported as a bug by Martijn Versteegh <versteegh@kvi.nl>.
* Hangs when InfView can't find a node.
* Bug in relative paths interpretation of the code that parses messages from
external programs.
* A GPF when the editor was stopped during a list play operation and it was
restored in another run.
* Now if you have two functions with the same name SDG will list both in the
index. Reported by Grzegorz.
* The editor added read-only copies to the list of closed windows when
closing one of them. It produced a crash when opening the file from the
closed list. Reported by Volker Kiefel <volker.kiefel@med.uni-rostock.de>.
* The syntax highlight for shell scripts needed EscapeAnywhere=1. Reported by
Grzegorz.
* A crash when deleting all the items (and one more ;-) in the MP3 list. Only
happend if you did it very quickly.
* When following a list of errors/hits with Alt+F8 in some cases the previous
hit wasn't cleared.
* The generation of .html files from the .txt ones. Now < and > are replaced.
Reported by Neil Parks <nparks@torah.org>.
* Now when passing a list of files to grep the filenames are quoted to avoid
problems with file names containing spaces. Reported by Grzegorz.
* When loading some old desktop files with black palettes (created by
some really old versions of the editor) you got a black screen. Now the editor
checks for such a silly situation and reverts to the default palette.
* The undo of the arbitrary indent used the starting selection instead of the
final one generating problems for long blocks.
* UnIndentBlock failed to update the syntax highlight, it was clear after
removing the comments in the block.
* The message window scrolled horizontally only 255 columns and lines
are allowed to be 1000 columns (then are wrapped). So now you can fully
scroll upto 1000 columns.
* A bug in "Intelligent C indent". A parenthesis after a / was not
counted leading to wrong indentation. I hope the new code really fixed it
without breaking other detail.
* If the errors.cle file wasn't there the editor crashed when you run external
programs. Reported by Grzegorz.
* When jumping to another manpage double clicking the name of the new one the
window didn't update their title.
* The GNU errors parsed was fulled by some gcc messages like it: In file
included by .....:line:\n Now those lines are discarded.
* When running `make' as the external program the editor keeps track
of the various directory changes that makes does (nested makefiles). That's
needed for programs that reports errors giving relative names. The problem
was that when using spanish messages the editor got confused. Now the
editor tries with english and if it fails tries translating it. Currently
only english and spanish are supported but that's done with the .mo file
so any language can be supported without recompiling.
* Now the Message Window only scrolls to the first line only if we collected
lines to jump. It was the original idea but was wrongly implemented.
* Now Prev/Next message are enabled only if the Message Window really have
lines to jump to.
* If no default options file was defined the default mask used to reset modes
was just 16 bits and not 32 clearing "Use indent size", "Don't purge spaces"
and "Backspace unindents". So they failed to be transfered from global to
local options.
* The generic error parsers some times added an extra / generating file names
with to consecutive / (invalid for UNIX).
* The option to open only the editor indicated in command line was broken.
* When enabling the column cursor in a window that wasn't restored from disk
it sometimes was shorter than what we expect. It was due to a wrong
initialization of CrossCursorCol member, the same could happend with the row
cursor.
* I was damaging argv[0]. It was easy to see when running ps, the editor name
had a space after the last slash.
* The "backspace unindents" could get confused with lines containing only
spaces.
* When adding items to a project the only way to exit is by pressing ESC, but
then the editor didn't remmember the path we used and when inserting again we
must get it from the history. Now remmembers it.
* When I changed from absolute to relative projects the memory of settings
for project items got broken.

+ Linux

* The editor didn't preserve the UID/GID of files when creating back-ups.
* When a manpage didn't exist Linux's man outputs to stderr a message. In the
past the editor missed it giving no help to the user and also letting an error
file in the home directory. Now stderr is also redirected and if stdout is
empty stderr is shown. Reported by "GiBa" <giba@lacasilla.com.ar>.
* A bug in the use of putenv, it made the editor fail to detect the /tmp dir.
As a result the editor created temporal files in the current directory.

+ Cosmetic

* Now the FileOpen dialog used in the project and MP3 list says "Done"
instead of "Cancel". Suggested by Waldemar Schultz <schultz@ma.tum.de>.
* Some spelling errors (remmember, allready and latter). Reported by
Bernd Becker <munin@munin.inka.de> and Philip (FireEgl) <FireEgl@EMail.com>.
* The 'D' shortcut was used twice in the redmond.smn for the File menu.
Reported by Jeremy W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.


  Changes in v0.4.41 (v.s. 0.4.39)

New [23 things]:

* Configurable mechanism to parse the errors collected from an external
application. It uses Perl RegEx to do the job. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now you can pass extra command line options using an environment variable
called SET_CMDLINE.
* Menu option to save the project manually. Suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
* Project window also says the name of the project file. Suggested by Jeremy
W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Command line option +[line number], like in VI. Suggested by Ivan.
* When calling the man page viewer the editor offers the word under cursor
as man page.
* Shl flag "EscapeAnywhere" this switch makes the editor parse the escape
character outside strings.
* Syntax highlight for PLM/51 contributed by Jari Korhonen
<jari.korhonen@ponsse.fi>. (Intel's long-gone not-so-highlevel language for
8051 CPUs).
* Command line switch to specify files to load from an external list of files
where each line is a file. Suggested by SpaZe.
* Three command line switches: --tile-vert, --tile-horiz and --cascade
to make these operations after loading the files from the desktop file or
named in the command line. Suggested by Spaze.
* The reverse operation for "HTML accents". Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now the file open dialog is resizeble. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Yet another tab mode. "Tab indents", it is by default enabled because
that's what the editor ever did. Disabling it the editor will behave like
when using tabs but will insert spaces instead of tabs.

+ Linux

* Debian package for InfView.
* ISO-8859-1 spanish messages.
* InfView man page. Pointed out by Ivan,
* Now the convert HTML accents feature also works in Linux, was just matter
of enabling it.
* Now the editor disables the Xon/Xoff mode of the terminal so ^Q/^S aren't
used for it. It enables the use of ^Q and ^S when running in an Xterm, Eterm,
etc.

+ DOS

* Now the editor also looks for HOME and HOMEDIR when loading configuration
files. Also: the directory where the exe is located is the one looked at last.

+ Cosmetic:

* Now the message window shows ^M if the line contains /r.
* Changed the way the INFOPATH is guessed under DOS. A djgpp user installed
the editor outside the djgpp tree and then the editor used INFOPATH but
failed to find the setedit.inf file. Now the editor also adds your tree even
if INFOPATH is defined. Reported by Sylvia <smlew@ifocus.com.sg>.
* Now if you use "load only specified files" the editor doesn't really load
the files to then close'm like before. It makes things faster.
* Now the new option to search the word when you press ^F1 inside
the node takes the visible name you choose from the list and not the word
under cursor. Suggested by Gregorio.


Fixed [10 things]:

* Problems with info files created with the new Texinfo 4.0 package.
* Abort when pressing ENTER in the message window without items.
* Bug in sLisp when handling strings with escape sequences (\n, \t, etc.).
Reported by Uwe Steinmann <steinm@majestix.fernuni-hagen.de>.
* GPF/SIGSEGV when using BackSpace in the functions list to delete the first
letter in the incremental search. Reported by Gregorio.
* Crashes when starting the editor and it was playing an MP3 file that doesn't
exist anymore.

+ Linux:

* Problems when saving files in DOS format. Reported by Gregorio.
* When switching from hidden to normal desktop files the editor left the
hidden version of the desktop file generating potential confusions. Now the
hidden file is removed.

+ DOS:

* Problems with project files. Reported by Ryan Owen <ryan@eyring.com>.

+ Cosmetic:

* The ~K~eep short-cut in the SDG options was used for O~K~. Reported
by Gregorio.
* When inserting items to the project the editor used the *.epr mask instead
of the one used to open regular files. Reported by Gregorio.

  For information about older releases and more read the change.log file.

Note for DOS users:
  %DJDIR% == The content of the enviroment variable %DJDIR%, that's the
  place where you installed djgpp. You don't need to set this variable,
  setting DJGPP is enough.



1. REQUIREMENTS:

* PC 386 compatible or superior computer.
* 2 Mb of memory or more.
* 2.4 Mb of free disk during installation and about 1.5 Mb once installed.
* DOS version 5.0 or posterior or any compatible OS (Win '9x, Win 3.1, OS/2,
MS-DOS, etc.). The NT platform isn't fully supported, I don't have NT, if you
need support for NT send me a licensed copy of NT ;-). I did my best to
support it, but as I don't have one at home I can't do more.
Note: A native windows version is available but is just for testing.
or
* Linux with ELF support for the Linux version. For console use you need gpm
1.14, older versions are incompatible.
* A VGA card.
* DJGPP users normally have it.



2. INSTALL:

  *Important* To use the powered grep you need the grep program installed in
your system. To use the man page viewer you need the man program installed in
your system. Both are found in all Linux systems but not in all DOS systems.
  Starting with v0.4.26 the DOS version of the editor is distributed with an
installer, if you have it just run install.exe and follow the instructions.
If you only have a .zip or .tar.gz file that contains a lot of files continue
reading this chapter.
  The following cases are explained:
  
A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users.
B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users.
C) Installing in Linux.

A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users:
1) Uncompress the file over your djgpp installation in the same way you did
   with the rest of packages.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/djgpp/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/djgpp with the place where you installed djgpp.

B) Installing in DOS for non-djgpp users:
   Attention: If you don't use the installer you must have some basic DOS
   knowledge, including: how to set an environment variable, modify your
   PATH and what is autoexec.bat. If you don't know it use the installer or
   ask a friend.
1) Uncompress the file in any directory you like preserving the directory
   structure. Examples:
    
   unzip edi0426b.zip
    or
   pkunzip -d edi0426b.zip
    or
   using WinZip (be careful to preserve the directories)
   
   For the other sections I'll give examples assuming you uncompressed the
   files in c:/setedit.
2) If you installed the editor preserving the directory structure you
   won't need to do it so the following is usually optional:
   Add the following to your autoexec.bat:

   SET SET_FILES=c:/setedit/share/setedit

   Replacing c:/setedit by the place where you uncompressed the editor.
3) Add the c:\setedit\bin (don't forget to replace c:/setedit by the name
   you used in 1) to the PATH in autoexec.bat.
   Example:

   PATH=.... <= Line already existent in your autoexec.bat
   SET PATH=c:\setedit\bin;%PATH%

C) Installing in Linux:
1) Uncompress the files in /tmp and run ./INSTALL_LINUX. If you want to setup
   the destination directory read the INSTALL_LINUX script. You'll need the
   make tool to run it, that's usually installed.
   Also: the script contains useful information about access rights needed
   to run the editor.
2) If you installed the editor in /usr or /usr/local the following is
   optional:
    
   Define the following environment variable (bash syntax):

   export SET_FILES="/usr/share/setedit"

   Replacing /usr by the prefix you used, example: prefix /opt then the
   editor is in /opt/bin and you must define:
   
   export SET_FILES="/opt/share/setedit"
3) Be sure the directory where setedit binary file is located is included in
   your PATH environment variable.

Note for bash users: the file where (2) and (3) should be defined is normally
called .bash_profile or .bashrc in your home directory.



3. MORE INFO:

  From v0.4.0 the editor doesn't need external files to configure the
keyboard so forget about the old xxx.txt files used in RHIDE 1.4.
  You will need to customize the colors from Various|Options|Colors, the ones
used by default aren't pretty.
  To save the default colors and settings go to the %SET_FILES% (examples:
c:/setedit/share/setedit, c:/djgpp/share/setedir, /usr/share/setedit)
directory, start the editor and set all the options (colors and settings
with Alt-G). Just exit and the editor will save a file called tcedit.dst.
Each time you start the editor in a directory where there isn't any *.dst
file the editor will load this default. Linux users that doesn't have write
access to the /usr tree can create a default in their home directory. In
this case the file should be created in ~/.setedit directory.
  Users that want to have only one tcedit.dst file, and not one in each
directory, must configure it in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor General.
  If you are annoyed with the back-up files and .dst files created by the
editor in all the places just exit with Alt+Q and the editor will delete
these files. Also see the options available in Tool&Ops|Options|Editor
General.



4. MP3: [Only in the DOS and Linux versions]

  Linux users doesn't need to configure any special thing.
  DOS users:
  The editor supports the Allegro mixing routines with 16 bits of resolution
(I contributed it to the Allegro project because I needed it for the editor).
  If you want to enable it create a file called allegro.cfg with the following
contents:

-------- cut here --------
[sound]
sb_freq = 45454
quality = 1
-------- cut here --------

  Put the file in the same directory where the editor is located.
  It will enable the 16 bits routines and mix with the maximun mixing
frequency.
  Enable it only if you are a fanatic because it will eat your CPU ;-).



5. EXAMPLES:

  SDG Example:

  To test the SDG tool you can uncompress the example.zip file in an empty
directory. Then call the editor with e and follow these steps:

1) Select the menu Project|Open and type test and enter. You'll get a new
project.
2) Press Insert and select the three .cc files pressing enter in each one,
the press ESC. Now you have the project filled.
3) Select Various|Options|SDG Options, and take a look to the selected
options, if you have SET_FILES right all must be Ok, so just press ENTER.
4) Press F9. The message window will appear with some messages.
5) Open the file out.html, it was generated when you pressed F9 (look the
syntax highlight).

  Load the file with any web browser and look the results. If you like it
for your code read the sdg.inf file (from the editor, if you don't know how
press F1 and then Ctrl-H to learn more about the help system).

  sLisp macros examples:

  In addition to the macros included in macros.slp (you can access these
macros from the Macros|Choose menu option) I included another, more simple,
examples in a file called examples.slp. It is located in the same directory
as the rest of the configuration files (/usr/share/setedit,
c:/djgpp/share/setedit, etc.).

  Turbo Pascal 7, also for other non-gnu compilers:

  Andreas Leidner <leidner@gmx.net> contributed some wrapper to call TPC7
from the editor and convert the errors into the FSF format so you can jump to
the function that originated the error from inside of the editor. This
examples is included in the directory where other .zip files are located
(contrib/setedit.bin or texts) and is called calltpc7.zip.



6. LEGAL ISSUE:

  The editor is free software.  It may be used or distributed in any manner
you wish, as long as you do not violate the GPL license.  You can't remove
any copyrigth included in the editor and you can't distribute it without any
of the original files. You will also distribute the sources if you distribute
the binaries. The GPL license is included in the package so read it before
distributing the editor.

  The editor comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; excluding any and all implied
warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  There is no warranty or representation, either express
or implied, with respect to this program, its quality, performance,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk
of using this program is with you.  There will be no liability for special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or resulting from the use
or modification of this program.



7. KEYBOARD PREFERENCES

  The keyboard is fully configurable from the Tool&Ops|Options|Keyboard|Key
assignment menu option. But this configures the keys used only by the editor
windows. The menu keys are defined in a text file with the .smn extension.
The file loaded by the editor for this purpose is called menubind.smn. An
example of how you can alter it to change some stuff is provided and called
redmond.smn, I think you can guess what's the effect of this menu
configuration ;-).
  If you used the installer one of the options offered was about changing
redmond.smn by menubind.smn.



8. KEYBOARD EXTENDER [DOS version only]

  In the contrib/setedit directory you'll find a small program called kextend
that's a very simple TSR (only needs 432 bytes of memory in my system) to
extend the BIOS functionallity.



9.  KEYBOARD FEATURES UNDER X [Linux version only]

  If you want to use the editor under X I recommend installing Eterm 0.8.10
and follow the instruction of the readme.txt file located in the eterm
directory of the configuration files (example:
/usr/share/setedit/eterm/readme.txt). Using it you'll get all the available
keyboard combinations (some of them are used by the Window Manager and
aren't accesible, I recommend Enlightenment where all the keyboards are
complex and also configured so they doesn't interfere).
  I uploaded to Source Forge the sources of Eterm 0.8.10, the patches
needed to generate a Debian package and my patches to enable the special
keyboard mode. You must install the sources and apply both sets of patches,
finally compile and install the package. For those using Debian Potato
I also uploaded binaries in .deb format. All is in the extra directory of
the Source Forge site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/setedit/
  If you use xterm you'll have some limitations imposed by common UNIX
terminal, example: Shift+Arrows reported as just arrows.
