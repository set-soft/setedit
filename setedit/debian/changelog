setedit (0.4.52-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Well, in the period of last testing of the stable release, some
    small issues where discovered and fixed. Note that the release was
    not announced, it was only announced on the setedit-users mailing
    list and as a prerelease. Lets hope that this becomes the real
    release.

setedit (0.4.52-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Arriba Uruguay nomá!!!" release, Uruguay goes to the Fifa
    World Soccer Championship Korea-Japan 2002, it was hard but our
    team made it!
  * Yes!!! New stable version of the editor!!!
  * Modified generated info files because Debian's install-info doesn't
    remove info files that specify "something.info" as their node, it
    needs "something" specified instead, and also, infview.info was
    being registered as infeng.info, which prevented it from being
    accessed from the main info file (the "dir" info file).
  * The infobrowser alternative (from infview) was being unregistered
    incorrectly.
  * Well, that's a lot of bugs I have found just before the stable
    release! I think two things:
    1 - I should do a more thorough testing while testing the unstable
      versions, to avoid surprises like these ones just before a stable
      release!
    2 - I don't have good testers of the packages or the people just
      doesn't bother to report the bugs.

setedit (0.4.51-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * No changes, just a newer upstream source from CVS and I will upload
    this version to the repository together with a little newer stable
    RHTVision, so people can test this release of the editor which is
    near to be the official stable one.

setedit (0.4.51-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The package was registering /usr/share/doc/setedit/editor.txt.gz as
    text documentation to doc-base, but it seems to have changed to
    setedit.txt.gz sometime and I forgot to modify it on the doc-base
    control file. I have noticed it when browsing with dpkg-www,
    lintian and doc-base didn't tell anything about it!

setedit (0.4.51-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated upstream sources from CVS, it has small bugfixes and tweaks
    here and there.
  * Now that I have installed UPX on my system, I realized that the
    infview binary is allways packed with UPX if it is available, and
    unfortunately upstream didn't provide an easy way of avoiding this,
    so I just modified upstream building system to be able to specify
    a new "--no-comp-exe" option to the configure script and we use
    that on debian/rules.

setedit (0.4.51-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (still a development release).
  * Changed Infview Debian package version numbering, yes, again. Now
    it is of the form "infview_0.2.7-0.4.51-1_i386.deb" and yes, is
    ugly, but is needed.
  * Added a Debian specific FAQ to the README.Debian file, explaining
    why the binaries are SUID root, why the infview package version
    numbering is like it is, and why the packages are not in Debian.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 21 Oct 2001 22:05:26 -0300

setedit (0.4.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's see if I can release while I am sleeping" release.
    That's because I am tired, I need some sleep and my eyelashes are
    closing some times, against my will. THIS RELEASE COMES WITHOUT
    WARRANTY.
  * Nice new upstream release, long live Salvador!
  * Upstream added a "buildpackage" script, I don't see the point of
    it but if it is of some use to Salvador or others, I will keep it.
  * Modified the new debian/buildpackage script to check before trying
    to do anything that it is being run from the right directory.
  * Added clean-debian to PHONY list.
  * Simplified the backup system by using a TAR archive instead of
    copying and moving files around. Good idea from Salvador. At the
    same time now timestamps are preserved so CVS checkins are faster.

setedit (0.4.49-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added missing Conflicts: suidmanager (<< 0.50) to INFView package.
  * Don't delete mp3/libamp/rhide.env on clean and added it to the
    backup system.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun,  7 Oct 2001 19:54:51 -0300

setedit (0.4.47-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create infview package with its own version and not setedit one,
    beware that I have not used an epoch, so the packaging tools will
    think that you are downgrading and that this version of infview is
    older.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sat, 29 Sep 2001 23:41:40 -0300

setedit (0.4.47-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Now clean target uses clean-debian target for the Debian cleaning.
  * Now it backups and restores original upstream files that are
    modified during the building process.
  * No more empty infview directories in the setedit package! I don't
    know why dh_movefiles doesn't remove the directory. I also
    discovered something funny: I allways check what the packages have
    inside using Midnight Commander, but it doesn't show empty
    directories so I didn't know of the problem until Salvador told me!
    Extracting with dpkg-deb that directories appear.

setedit (0.4.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version!
  * Standards version 3.5.2.0.
  * Long time ago, the RHTVision package had to be removed from the
    Debian distribution because of yet unresolved legal problems with
    Inprise, this package depends on that library and so couldn't be
    distributed, so, this package is now unofficial.
  * Updated build-depends.
  * Updated description, README.Debian, etc. to reflect that this is
    not an official Debian package.
  * Use versioned build dependency on DebHelper instead of using
    deprecated dh_testversion.
  * Convert from suidregister to statoverride.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 12 Aug 2001 22:05:56 -0300

setedit (0.4.39-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from upstream author that allows the documentation to
    be created on systems with a new incompatible version of makeinfo.
    I have made further modifications to the file doc/set.txt because
    it was creating the table of contents twice.
    Also I have commented out the line saying @contents in the files
    doc/editor.tx and doc/sdg.tx because it was doing weird things to
    the table of contents.
    Closes: #53277.

setedit (0.4.39-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now builds the standalone InfoViewer and puts it in a different
    package called infview.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue, 21 Dec 1999 16:11:56 -0300

setedit (0.4.39-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards version 3.1.0.
  * Added Build-Depends.
  * Architecture set to "any" instead of "i386" as requested by
    Roman Hodek. This program isn't tested on other architectures other
    than i386, so, testing is needed and reports of success or failures
    will be apreciated.
    Closes: #50319.
  * Instead of suggesting tetex-bin and tetex-base, now suggests
    texinfo, since the makeinfo program moved from tetex-bin to the
    package texinfo.
  * Call dh_clean without the -k flag in the install target.
  * Don't use install-stamp (in rules file) anymore, to avoid possible
    duplicate strings in maintainer script fragment files (see
    debhelper changelog of version 2.0.56).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed,  1 Dec 1999 13:12:30 -0300

setedit (0.4.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Code page remaping.
    - Man page viewer follows links to other manpages.
    - New Tex and TCL syntax highlights.
    - new 27 code pages supported!
    - Various bugfixes and other enhancements.
  * Now uses new upstream makefile clean target for cleaning.
  * We prevent building of infoviewer to prevent problems by now.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue, 26 Oct 1999 15:07:28 -0300

setedit (0.4.36-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Better descriptions for the editor (thanks Salvador!).
  * Now Recommends: man.
  * Now has manpage for the "e" symlink (lintian complained).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 29 Sep 1999 20:35:49 -0300

setedit (0.4.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Various bugfixes and enhancements.
    - New building system!
  * Modified building system for upstream new building system and FHS
    move.
  * Now requires DEBHelpers 2.0.40.
  * DOC-Base support was not working, now works and also registers INFO
    files.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 22 Sep 1999 15:05:37 -0300

setedit (0.4.25-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from upstream author to correct the patchenv.pl perl
    script that was preventing correct compilation.
  * Initial support for docbase (just plain text documentation, more
    will follow), untested.
  * Worked around bug related to the set_new_handler() function that
    was preventing linkage.
  * Now in the rhide.env file, we define SUPPORT_INC to none, to avoid
    linkage of support libraries provided by upstream author and use
    the Debian ones. Removed a little hack on the rules makefile
    because of this.
  * Better maintainer.notes file.
  * Better README.Debian file.
  * Added upstream download information in the copyright file.
  * Added Suggests: grep, doc-base, tetex-bin, tetex-base.
  * Added dh_testversion 1.2.9, because I use dh_links now.
  * The /usr/bin/e symlink was set incorrectly.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue,  1 Jun 1999 15:27:33 -0300

setedit (0.4.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Various bugfixes (a lot due to memory problems reported by the
      YAMD tool).
    - Uses the new version 2 of the PCRE library.
    - Now incorporates the Debian building files.
    - The binary executables are compressed with UPX now (not in Debian
      tough).
    - Updated documentation.
    - Enhanced and killed bugs in the building scripts (partly because
      of the Debian packaging).
    - Added syntax highlight for Python.
    - Now the executable in Linux is called "setedit" instead of "e"
      and "e" is now a symlink to "setedit".
    - Renamed the editor info file from "editor.info" to
      "setedit.info".
    - Renamed the language file from "editor.mo" to "setedit.mo".
    - Now the editor searches for its files in the /usr hierarchy
      instead of only in /usr/local (so, the setting of an environment
      variable is not necessary now).
    - Other minor enhancements.
  * Changed the Debian build scripts to acomodate upstream changes.
  * Now the executable is suid root because this makes significant
    improvements on speed and upstream author says it is safe.
  * Now the Debian build scripts doesn't do a copy and restore of all
    the "makes" directory, instead it just copies and restores after
    compilation the files that change only, so, it builds faster now.

setedit (0.4.24-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now -pipe option to gcc passed (faster compilation).
  * Dummy gpr2mak script not required anymore.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue, 30 Mar 1999 14:55:13 -0300

setedit (0.4.24-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now the executable of the editor is SUID root registered (much more
    faster!).
  * The mp3/libamp/libamp.mak file was not restored to the original on
    the clean-debian target.
  * Now the editor info file is registered in the dir main menu
    info page (I was trying to register it using the debian/info file
    but it doesn't work that way, I am doing it manually but keep the
    debian/info file I was trying to use as debian/info.ex in case
    someone else wants to look in it to see what is wrong with it).
  * The upstream changelog was called change.log.gz, now it is renamed
    to changelog.gz to suit Debian policy (Lintian complained).
  * Now the clean target doesn't depend on clean-debian anymore.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 24 Mar 1999 18:23:54 -0300

setedit (0.4.24-1) unstable; urgency=low
